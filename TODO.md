## 🚨 Critical Gaps to Address

### 1. AI/LLM Integration Issues

**Current State**: AI features exist but are disabled by default (`LLM_ENABLED=False`)

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Enable LLM by default** - Update config to set `LLM_ENABLED=True`
- [ ] **Improve LLM prompts** - The 4 existing prompts are basic and need refinement for production use
- [ ] **Add robust error handling** - LLM failures should gracefully fall back to rule-based scoring
- [ ] **Add cost controls** - Implement token limits and budget controls for LLM usage
- [ ] **Optimize LLM usage** - Only use AI for complex documents where rule-based confidence is low

**Technical Tasks**:
```python
# Update src/config.py
LLM_ENABLED: bool = Field(default=True)  # Currently False

# Enhance src/prompts/*.md files with production-ready prompts
# Add token counting and cost estimation
# Implement intelligent LLM routing based on document complexity
```

### 2. Scoring System Enhancements

**Current State**: Basic keyword matching with hardcoded weights

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Semantic keyword matching** - Add synonym expansion and fuzzy matching
- [ ] **Dynamic weight adjustment** - Allow per-organization weight customization
- [ ] **Evidence quality scoring** - Improve snippet extraction and relevance assessment
- [ ] **Cross-dimensional validation** - Ensure scoring dimensions don't conflict

**Technical Tasks**:
```python
# Add to src/scoring/dimensions.py
class SemanticMatcher:
    def expand_keywords(self, keywords: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Add synonyms, related terms, common variations
        
class DynamicWeightEngine:
    def calculate_weights(self, context: Dict, document_type: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
        # Adjust weights based on context and document characteristics
```

### 3. Quality Assurance Gaps

**Current State**: Limited test coverage and no quality metrics

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Comprehensive test suite** - Unit tests for all scoring dimensions
- [ ] **Integration test scenarios** - End-to-end workflow testing with real documents
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** - Establish baseline performance metrics
- [ ] **Accuracy validation** - Create ground truth dataset for scoring validation

**Technical Tasks**:
```python
# Expand tests/unit/ with comprehensive coverage
# Add tests/integration/test_scoring_accuracy.py
# Create tests/benchmarks/ for performance testing
# Add ground truth scoring dataset in tests/test_data/
```
