# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for the Political Monitoring Agent production workflows and testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Core Utility Scripts**

These scripts are integrated into the main workflow via `justfile` commands and provide essential functionality:

```bash
# Sync config for deployment (auto-run by just dev)
just sync-config
```

### **Azure Storage Management**
#### `import_data_to_azurite.py`
Import local data to Azurite (Azure Storage Emulator) for development.

```bash
# Import all data
just azure-import

# Import with custom job ID
just azure-import-job my_job_123

# Dry run (preview)
just azure-import-dry

# Verify connection
just azure-verify
```

### **ETL Pipeline Management**

```

## üß™ **Development Testing Scripts**

Located in `_dev_testing/` - these are ad-hoc scripts created during development for testing specific features:

- **ETL Testing**: `etl_test_summary.py`, `test_etl_*` files
- **News Collection**: `compare_news_collectors.py`, `test_exa_*` files  
- **Document Processing**: `full_document_processing.py`, `process_*` files
- **GraphRAG**: `test_graphrag_langfuse.py`, `explore_graphiti_mcp_search.py`
- **Validation**: `validate_*`, `verify_*`, `inspect_*` files

These scripts are preserved for reference but not part of the main workflow.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Start all services
just services-up

# Deploy Flow1 with config sync
just dev

# Build communities manually
just build-communities

# Test policy collection
just policy-test

# Import sample data
just azure-import

# Upload prompts
just upload-prompts
```

## Prerequisites

- **Services Running**: `just services-up`
- **Environment**: Valid API keys in `.env`
- **Dependencies**: `uv sync` for Python packages
