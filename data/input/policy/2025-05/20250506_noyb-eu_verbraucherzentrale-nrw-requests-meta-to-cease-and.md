# Verbraucherzentrale NRW requests Meta to cease and desist AI training in the EU

On 14 April, Meta announced that it would use the personal data of European users for artificial intelligence (AI) training in the future. Starting on 27 May, the company will use all posts published on Instagram and Facebook for AI training. The company falsely claims to have a legitimate interest in this extensive data use – even though it should actually ask those affected for their consent. noyb filed a series of GDPR complaints against Meta's plans in 2024, prompting the Irish DPA to temporarily halt the plans. Although the legality of the plans has still not been clarified by the authorities, Meta is now pressing ahead and ignoring the fundamental right to data protection of all affected Europeans. The Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia has now officially requested to Meta to cease and desist its AI training plans in the EU - and is considering further legal steps if the company fails to respond. noyb fully supports the Verbraucherzentrale's action.  
 Press release by the Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia Original noyb complaints Meta's announcement to train AI on EU data Cease and desist letter. The Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia (in Germany) has sent Meta a cease and desist letter on 30 April 2025, requesting the company to stop its AI plans for Instagram and Facebook . If the company doesn't "voluntarily comply with this request", the consumer rights organisation will consider further legal action. "Time is of the essence, because once data has been fed into AI, it is very difficult to retrieve it again", Data protection expert at the Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia said in a statement. Below you can find initial statements by Max Schrems: "Meta is deliberately trying to ignore European law and is putting its commercial interests above the fundamental right to data protection of those affected." "The laws apply throughout Europe and we support the initiative of the Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia 100%." "Meta should simply ask the affected people for their consent. But if Meta ignores EU law, there will be consequences for the whole of Europe."
