# Why U.S. shoppers face surprise tariff bills

U.S. consumers are encountering unexpected fees on online purchases as new tariffs on Chinese imports take effect, leading to frustration and confusion among shoppers. 
 President Donald Trump's administration has imposed a 30% tariff on most products from China and closed the "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed goods under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free. As a result, consumers are receiving notices from carriers such as UPS and DHL, demanding additional payments to release their packages. These fees, often not disclosed at the time of purchase, have caught many shoppers off guard.  
 Ben Dominguez-Benner, a programmer in Austin, Texas, received an email from UPS on May 2 with a bill for $137.42 in "fees and taxes" for a $183 cord organizing system he purchased from Swedish company CRDBAG. CRDBAG informed him that the unexpected import charge was due to one item in his order containing materials from China. 
 "I definitely will be buying from a domestic vendor who hopefully has already jacked the rate or tells you what it is," he said, looking to avoid unexpected charges in the future.  
 Industry experts suggest that these surprise fees are part of a transitional period as retailers and carriers adjust to the new tariff regulations. Britain Pavlic, director of transportation at supply chain consulting firm enVista, noted that many of these bills may have occurred when tariffs were newly implemented or changing and as small or midsize companies were learning to navigate the new import processes.  
 "I would think this is probably part of a transition period from costs being missed from times of checkout," he said. 
 Carriers like UPS and DHL often act as customs brokers, collecting duties on behalf of customs agencies. UPS advises international shippers to inform recipients of potential charges before transactions to avoid surprises.  
 The impact of these tariffs is not limited to the U.S. The European Union plans to introduce a €2 flat fee on billions of small parcels entering the EU, primarily from Chinese e-commerce platforms like Temu and Shein. This handling fee aims to offset the administrative and customs costs associated with the 4.6 billion packages imported directly to consumers each year.  
 Shein, a major low-cost online retailer, has warned that French consumers may face higher prices due to proposed EU and French regulations. Quentin Ruffat, Shein's France spokesperson, criticized the EU's plan to impose a €2 handling fee on e-commerce parcels entering the bloc, viewing it as a challenge for platforms like Shein and Temu that benefit from shipping low-cost products directly to buyers.  
 To avoid unexpected fees, consumers are advised to research a brand's shipping and customs policies before making purchases. Some brands use terms like "Delivered Duty Unpaid" (DDU), meaning the customer is responsible for covering any import duties. In contrast, others use "Delivered Duty Paid" (DDP), where the seller includes all fees upfront.  
 Economists have been warning that high tariff rates imposed by the U.S. will lead to higher prices for consumers. Experts recommend shopping from domestic retailers that stock international brands. Many U.S.-based stores and marketplaces import popular foreign products in bulk and handle customs clearance themselves, bundling all associated costs into the retail price. Consumers can look for authorized local distributors or check if global brands have regional websites or storefronts that fulfill orders from within the U.S.
