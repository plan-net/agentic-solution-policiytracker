In This Article: Broadridge Financial Solutions has teamed up with sustainability software innovator Novisto to provide an advanced system that streamlines and enhances corporate sustainability data reporting and management. With companies facing increasing regulatory and investor pressure to disclose non-financial performance, the need for robust, scalable sustainability reporting tools has never been greater. This collaboration combines Broadridge’s deep experience supporting public companies with Novisto’s advanced ESG technology to offer a seamless, end-to-end solution for sustainability data collection, analysis, and disclosure. Ryan Wade, general manager, Broadridge Corporate Issuer stated: "With continued focus from investors and regulators globally on sustainable business models, it's imperative that companies implement effective means to capture, analyse, and report on material sustainability data. Broadridge's collaboration with Novisto empowers management teams to efficiently produce high-quality and investor-ready disclosures that meet both voluntary and regulatory standards." Broadridge provides important corporate issuer services to over 3,400 public firms in the United States, such as proxy and shareholder communications, governance and sustainability, regulatory filings, and stock transfers. The relationship with Novisto strengthens Broadridge's sustainability capabilities by allowing clients to better handle stakeholder expectations, third-party questionnaires, ESG rating agency standards, and supply chain transparency. Furthermore, the fully integrated solution offers peer benchmarking and strategic advice, allowing businesses to manage and report on all aspects of ESG data in one place. It attempts to improve internal operations while also assuring compliance with rising global standards like the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) framework. According to the IFRS Foundation, 30 jurisdictions have already committed to adopting ISSB standards by November 2024, emphasising the importance of standardised and accurate reporting tools. Charles Assaf, CEO of Novisto added: "We are thrilled to collaborate with Broadridge, a company celebrated for its expertise and steadfast commitment to delivering high-quality corporate issuer solutions. Novisto's technological prowess in the sustainability reporting space, combined with Broadridge's trusted expertise and transformative data and technology, sets a powerful precedent for streamlining corporate reporting processes."
