The fashion company s.Oliver has initially focused on its own online shop for product transparency. Since May 2024, there has been a tracing function for selected products and collections that can be used via the browser. This allows customers to track the origin of their clothing. 
 This function reveals where and by whom the clothing was manufactured and which standards were met in terms of materials and social responsibility. All verifications and certifications have been checked by independent third parties, according to s.Oliver. 
 One example of this is the "Empowering Farmers" collection, which supports Indian farmers in switching to organic cotton. By working directly with cotton cooperatives, the supply chain, through to the production level, is made traceable. The "360° Denim" product capsule, which consists of at least 20% certified recycled cotton and uses resource-saving finishing processes, is also equipped with the tracing function. 
 The tracing function is provided in collaboration with technology partner Retraced. Sabrina Müller, Head of Sustainability at the s.Oliver Group, promises that the feature will be extended to other collections in the future: "We want to make sustainability more tangible for our customers. This includes providing credible proof of sustainability statements through transparency and traceability. In this way, we are helping to enable and promote more responsible consumption and more conscious purchasing decisions."
