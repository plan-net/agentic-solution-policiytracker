Investing.com -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:). has stopped orders for various products manufactured in China and other Asian nations. This move is seen as an effort by the company to lessen its vulnerability to tariffs established by President Donald Trump, according to a document examined by Bloomberg and sources familiar with the situation. The order cancellations for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners, and other goods from numerous Amazon vendors came after Trumpâ€™s April 2 declaration of his intention to impose tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories. The list of affected regions includes China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The abrupt nature of these cancellations led vendors to believe it was a reaction to the tariffs. The extent of the cancellations and the variety of merchandise impacted remain unclear. A vendor who has supplied beach chairs made in China to Amazon for over ten years received an email from the company last week. The email, which was examined by Bloomberg, stated that Amazon was cancelling some purchase orders it had made "in error" and asked the vendor not to dispatch them. The email did not refer to tariffs. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&amp;C. 3rd party Ad.
