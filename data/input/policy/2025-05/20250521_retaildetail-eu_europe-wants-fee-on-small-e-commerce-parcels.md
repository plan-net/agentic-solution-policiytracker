With a two-euro handling fee on every small parcel entering Europe, the European Commission wants to fund customs checks as the influx of parcels from Shein and Temu continues to grow. 
 Compensating costs 
 Packages worth less than 150 euros from third countries escape customs duties today. European Trade Commissioner Maroc Sefcovic wants to put an end to that: he proposes charging two euros for each small parcel entering Europe. The money, paid by e-commerce platforms, should serve to finance customs checks. ‘That is why I would not call this handling fee a tax, but simply a compensation for the costs,’ he says. 
 Indeed, customs are overwhelmed by the ever-increasing influx of parcels: in 2024, some 4.6 billion parcels of less than 150 euros entered the EU, or 145 per second. 91% of these came from China. Moreover, with the announced increased customs duties in the United States, Europe expects an additional influx of small parcels via platforms such as Shein and Temu. Those parcels escape controls. 
 Belgian trade federation Comeos welcomes the plan: ‘This is an important step towards fair competition, a measure Comeos has long advocated. Customs figures show that 2.5 million parcels are sent from outside Europe to Belgium every day, many of which come from China. This year we will end up with 1 billion parcels, twice as many as last year. Only 0.005% of these parcels can be checked,’ said the federation on LinkedIn.
