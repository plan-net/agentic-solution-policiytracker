 New Privacy Regulations for E-Commerce in 2025 
 Read the overview of the key regulatory changes impacting e-commerce businesses in 2025: 
 General Product Safety Regulation 
 The General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR, or Regulation 2023/988) came into force on December 13, 2024, bringing new responsibilities for manufacturers, importers, and distributors who sell consumer products in the EU. GPSR replaces the previous General Product Safety Directive. 
 GPSR sets the following requirements for e-commerce stores: 
 
 Mandatory risk assessments Businesses selling products in the EU must conduct safety evaluations before introducing them to the EU market. 
 Enhanced labeling Products must display the manufacturer’s information: full name or company name, registered trade name, and postal and electronic contact details. Online products must contain clear details like type, model, images, or other identifying information. Products must also include safety warnings on packaging or in accompanying documents. Safety warnings must be written in languages easily understood by consumers in the target market. 
 Handling defective products E-commerce stores must register with the EU Safety Gate portal  and cooperate with authorities to remove unsafe products swiftly. If a product is found to be defective and could pose a risk, manufacturers, importers, and distributors are required to remove it from the market immediately and either repair it, replace it, or give a full refund to consumers. 
 
 European Accessibility Act 
 The European Accessibility Act ( EAA) became effective on April 26, 2024. The Act requires manufacturers, importers, distributors, and service providers to ensure digital products and services are accessible to all individuals, particularly those with disabilities. 
 The EEA requires e-commerce stores and businesses to implement the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) guidelines which define how to create accessible web content. 
 Digital products and services must be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. 
 
 Perceivable Content should be accessible by several methods. For example, e-commerce businesses could use alternative text for images to help screen reader users, allow text resizing without affecting the reading quality, or ensure strong contrast between text and background. 
 Operable Your e-commerce store should allow users to use various input and interface methods, such as keyboards or mice, for navigation.  Avoid flashing content that could trigger seizures for some consumers. 
 Understandable E-commerce stores must write content in simple and straightforward language. Navigation must be easy and intuitive, have logical content layout, and predictable page behavio r. 
 Robust Websites must be compatible with many devices and technologies, including different browsers, screen readers, and mobile devices. Microenterprises are exempt from some of these requirements.

 Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation 
 Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) entered into force on 11 February 2025. PPWR introduces stricter rules on packaging waste and sustainability. 
 E-commerce stores should follow these recommendations: 
 
 Reduce packaging waste E-commerce stores should minimize packaging and promote recyclability. 
 Use sustainable material E-commerce stores should use sustainable and eco-friendly packaging materials to reduce packaging waste. 
 Innovate logistics E-commerce stores are expected to use innovative logistics and technologies to optimize packaging and reduce waste. 
 
 European Green Deal / Sustainable Development Regulations 
 The European Green Deal is the EU’s ambitious strategy to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The law sets the requirements for the EU's climate, energy, transport and 
 E-commerce businesses should educate consumers about eco-friendly choices and carbon footprints. They should reduce waste and use zero-emission logistics or sustainable delivery options. 
 Customs reforms and platform responsibility 
 Under the new EU customs reforms, e-commerce stores will be responsible for the safety and compliance of products sold on their sites. 
 
 Platform liability Online marketplaces such as Amazon, Temu, Shein, or AliExpress will be liable for ensuring that products sold are safe and meet EU standards. 
 Data sharing with authorities E-commerce platforms must provide detailed product information to EU customs authorities before goods enter the EU. This is expected to improve product inspection and control. 
 Removal of duty exemptions The EU plans to phase out the customs duty exemption for goods under €150. This is expected to ensure that all imported products should have appropriate duties and taxes. 
 
 Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act 
 Digital Services Act ( DSA) and Digital Markets Act ( DMA) became effective in 2024 and will continue to impact e-commerce in 2025. They aim to: 
 
 Enhancing transparency and providing greater algorithmic accountability The DSA obliges all online platforms to disclose why people see specific information and how algorithms recommend products or content. Consumers also have the right to select a recommendation system that is not based on profiling. 
 Restricting illegal content online The DSA defines unified criteria for notice-and-action procedures to determine how online platforms should act when they detect illegal content and when platforms should be held liable for the dissemination of illegal content. Please note that the DSA prohibits general content monitoring to find any unlawful content. 
 Ensuring fair competition and preventing self-preferencing The DSA and DMA mandate gatekeepers not to abuse their market position and favor their own products over other businesses. 
 Ban on dark patterns The DSA seeks to ban manipulating users' choices through dark patterns or deceptive designs. 
 Better reporting and compensation for individuals People are provided with more options to report harmful content and to appeal decisions made about the removal of their own content. Individuals have a right to seek compensation for any damage caused by platform infringements. 
 
 Payment Security Standards (PCI DSS v4.0) 
 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) version 4.0 becomes mandatory on March 31, 2025. The initial standard was created in 2004 and requires to provide an adequate security for credit card, cash card, and debit card transactions and protection of cardholder account information. The PCI DSS applies for all organizations that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. 
 Key updates in 2025 include: 
 
 Enhanced security measures The PCI DSS v 4.0 sets stricter requirements for securing payment data and requires improvement in protection against current threats to align with current best security practices. 
 Stricter password requirements PCI DSS v4.0 requires a password with a minimum of 12 characters, including numeric and alphabetical characters. Users must also use Multifactor Authentication (MFA) or change the password every three months. 
 Internal vulnerability scanning Internal vulnerability scans must be performed at least every three months. If high-risk, critical vulnerabilities are found, they must be fixed. 
 Compliance requirements All businesses handling card payments must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. The fines for non-compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard range from $5,000 to $100,000 per month. 
 
 Digital Product Passport 
 The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is an initiative under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). Although EDPP has not yet come into force (it is scheduled for 2026), 2025 is the best time to prepare for these changes. Many businesses are already implementing the DPP requirements. Almost all products sold in the EU will have to have a Digital Product Passport. 
 DPP mandates to provide consumers with detailed information about products, including: 
 
 The exact composition of the products. 
 The source of raw materials and the carbon footprint of the product. 
 Safety certifications and compliance with standards. 
 Recycling options and guidelines for disposal of goods. 
 
 This information should be available to consumers in digital form. 
 In 2024, CookieScript Consent Management Platform ( CMP) was nominated as the best CMP on G2, a peer-review website for compliance with the GDPR and other privacy laws. Use CookieScript to comply with the above-mentioned privacy laws. 
 Balancing Personalization, Tracking &amp; Privacy Regulations in 2025 
 E-commerce businesses must know the laws and adapt to these regulatory changes in 2025 to protect consumer privacy and ensure compliance. 
 Let’s overview the new tracking technologies and evolving trends in e-commerce in 2025. 
 First-party data 
 With Third-Party Cookies rapidly phasing out, businesses are turning to First-party data collected directly from customers through Cookie Consent banners. As of 2025, Safari (Apple), Firefox (Mozilla), Brave, and DuckDuckGo Browser block Third-Party Cookies by default. Chrome has delayed the fading out of third-party cookies. 
 Read more about why third-party cookies are going away and what are third-party cookie alternatives. 
 Using first-party data for personalized ads is one of the most privacy-compliant strategies in 2025. E-commerce stores could use first-party data for ad personalization. 
 Use the following steps for user tracking and personalization with the first-party data: 
 
 Collect the correct first-party data Gather customer data such as purchase history, search queries, browsing behavior on your site, newsletter or email engagement, and loyalty program usage. Make sure to get explicit user consent to collect and use this data for personalized marketing. 
 Segment your audience   Once collected, segment your audience into meaningful categories, such as frequent buyers vs. one-time visitors, interest categories (e.g., eco-conscious), business vs individual buyers, seasonal or holiday shoppers, etc. 
 Provide segmented data into Ad platforms  Upload first-party customer lists to platforms like Google Ads, Meta Ads, or TikTok for Business. These platforms allow you to create similar audiences and use customer match features to retarget known users across search engines, YouTube, Instagram, etc. Even though these tools work best with Third-Party Cookies, they also allow retargeting without Third-Party Cookies when integrated properly with consent and server-side tracking. 
 Personalize messaging   Customize your ads based on demographic or interest segment. Show product ads for items the user viewed or added to the cart but didn’t buy and highlight recommendations based on previous purchases. 
 Respect user privacy   Respect user rights under laws like GDPR, CPRA, etc. Use a Consent Management Platform ( CMP) to gather and store user consent. 
 
 Cookieless data 
 For ad personalization, use cookieless tracking solutions  such as fingerprinting, session replay, or cohort analysis 
 Cookieless tracking could also be done on the server side. The anonymous tracker sends data directly to your chosen website tracking tool (e.g. Google Analytics) which provides a complete picture of your audience. 
 Regularly audit tracking scripts and tag managers to ensure you’re not unintentionally collecting or sharing data with non-compliant third parties. 
 Scan your website for free to see all your website cookies and other website trackers your website uses: 
 Predictive personalization without PII 
 AI is now able to deliver relevant content without necessarily storing or processing personally identifiable information ( PII). Different AI tools can be used for predictive personalization. Server-side tracking and contextual targeting should also be used to compensate for data loss due to third-party data restrictions. 
 Always provide opt-out mechanisms and respect “Do Not Track” and Global Privacy Control signals where required. 
 How Could E-Commerce Platforms Comply with Privacy Regulations in 2025? 
 In conclusion, the e-commerce landscape has undergone significant regulatory transformations in 2025, particularly within the European Union. Many new privacy regulations have come into force. Third-party cookies are fading, so new ads personalization options such as first-party data, cookieless data, or predictive personalization without PII are emerging. So, how could e-commerce platforms comply with privacy regulations in 2025?

 Frequently Asked Questions 
 What are the key regulations e-commerce businesses need to follow in 2025? 
 The main regulations for e-commerce in 2025 include: GDPR (EU), CPRA (California), General Product Safety Regulation (EU), Digital Services Act (EU), Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, the European Accessibility Act, and Payment Security Standards v4.0. Use CookieScript   CMP to comply with the above-mentioned laws in 2025. 
 How could e-commerce platforms comply with privacy regulations in 2025? 
 Use Consent Management Platform (CMP) to comply with different consent requirements.

CookieScript   CMP offers all these functions and more. 
 How do Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) help with compliance? 
 CMPs help collect, store, and manage user consent in line with regional laws. They inform users about personal data collection and give users options to accept, reject, or customize tracking preferences, and provide proof of consent for audits. The geo-targeting functionality of CMP allows companies to present different cookie banners and comply within different jurisdictions. Use CookieScript   CMP to comply with major privacy laws. 
 Are third-party cookies still allowed in 2025? 
 Most major browsers, including Safari, Firefox, and Brave, block third-party cookies by default. Google Chrome still uses third-party cookies but is phasing them out globally via the Privacy Sandbox. As a result, relying on third-party cookies is no longer viable for compliant tracking or ad personalization. Use first-party data or cookieless data instead.
