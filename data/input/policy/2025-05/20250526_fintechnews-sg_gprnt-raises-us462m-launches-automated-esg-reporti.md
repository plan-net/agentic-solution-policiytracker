Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox Sustainability data platform Gprnt has secured US$4.62 million in seed funding from Ant International and MUFG Bank. The funding will support the company’s efforts to strengthen its digital infrastructure, enhance AI capabilities, and accelerate the onboarding of partners across Singapore and the wider region. Both investors will integrate Gprnt into their ecosystems to support clients in ESG disclosures, supply chain sustainability, and access to green finance. Following the fundraise, Gprnt has launched what it describes as the world’s first nationwide utility for sustainability reporting. Developed as a digital platform under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and part of the Global Finance and Technology Network (GFTN), Gprnt enables companies—particularly SMEs—to automatically generate basic sustainability metrics, such as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, using government-sourced utilities data. Companies in Singapore can retrieve their water, town gas, and electricity consumption figures from PUB and the Energy Market Authority via GovTech’s Myinfo business service, with data access secured through Corppass login and user consent. The data is processed on the Gprnt platform within minutes and at no cost, simplifying a typically complex and costly reporting process. Gprnt is described as the first digital platform globally to enable all companies within a nation to generate baseline ESG metrics with minimal effort, using government-sourced data, and to match them with public and private sector partners offering incentives for disclosures. The platform also includes a value-added services marketplace and supports Singapore’s ambition to lead in green finance and digital ESG infrastructure. Gprnt was launched in 2023 by MAS as part of the GFTN. It provides automated disclosure tools and an interoperable data platform designed to make sustainability reporting more accessible and actionable. Ravi Menon “High-integrity sustainability data is critical for businesses to formulate effective transition plans for decarbonisation. Yet, harnessing such data is often costly and complex for SMEs, especially at a time when they are facing global trade headwinds and economic uncertainties. Gprnt will empower businesses to undertake sustainability reporting at lower cost and with less pain. It will help them better manage the tensions between dealing with heightened cost pressures while building strategic capabilities to thrive in the green economy of the future.” said Ravi Menon, Chairman of the GFTN Board of Directors and Singapore’s Ambassador for Climate Action. Lionel Wong “This marks a pivotal moment, not just for Gprnt, but for the future of sustainability reporting. With our investors and strategic partners, we’ve built a landmark solution that empowers companies of all sizes to transform ESG reporting and data from a burden to a bridge, at minimal cost and fuss. We’re excited to put Gprnt into the hands of more governments, financial institutions, corporates, and SMEs, to jointly shape a world where sustainable business models and practices become the norm.” said Lionel Wong, Executive Director, Gprnt.
