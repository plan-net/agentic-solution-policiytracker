China has halted drone sales to Ukraine and other European countries but continues to supply Russia, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing statements from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other informed sources. “Chinese Mavic is open for Russians but is closed for Ukrainians. There are production lines on Russian territory where there are Chinese representatives,” Zelensky reportedly told journalists. A European official who spoke to Bloomberg said Zelensky’s remarks align with the E.U.’s own assessments. According to the official, China also appears to have restricted deliveries of certain drone components, including magnets used in drone motors, to Western buyers, while increasing shipments to Russia. Beijing denies supplying weapons to either side and insists it maintains strict controls on dual-use goods that could have military applications. “China’s stance on Ukraine issue has been consistent and clear: we have been committed to stopping the war and promoting peace talks,” China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement to Bloomberg.
