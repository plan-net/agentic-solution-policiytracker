European focus on e-commerce regulation welcomed by Euralarm 
 Euralarm has responded to the European Commission’s Communication on E-Commerce, stating its support for proposals aimed at enhancing consumer safety and fair competition in online marketplaces. 
 The Communication, titled ‘A Comprehensive EU Toolbox for Safe and Sustainable E-commerce’, outlines technical approaches to address concerns over product safety, regulatory compliance and market fairness. 
 According to Euralarm, the rapid growth of e-commerce in Europe has led to the increased availability of low-cost imports that fail to meet essential safety and security requirements. 
 Fire and security industry highlights risks from unsafe imports 
 Euralarm reported that a rising number of products entering the European market through online platforms are non-compliant with EU safety, cybersecurity and quality standards. 
 It stated that these products pose risks to both consumers and businesses by undermining the integrity of the market. 
 Euralarm added that its members, who operate in the fire safety and security sector, support stronger enforcement mechanisms to prevent non-compliant products from reaching consumers. 
 It said this approach would protect safety standards and ensure a level playing field for businesses meeting regulatory obligations. 
 Alignment with EU digital and safety legislation 
 Euralarm said the proposals support the application of several EU laws, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, Cyber Resilience Act and General Product Safety Regulation. 
 The organisation explained that improving enforcement and surveillance in e-commerce is key to applying these regulations across online and offline marketplaces. 
 It stated that aligning policy with enforcement efforts will help maintain consumer trust and support the development of compliant safety and security solutions. 
 Industry support for fair and transparent regulation 
 Euralarm said it supports measures that ensure compliant European businesses are not disadvantaged by competitors distributing low-quality or unsafe products. 
 It said effective surveillance of e-commerce platforms and proper enforcement will enable innovation to continue within the EU’s legal framework. 
 The organisation added that fire safety and security providers are committed to maintaining standards that protect public safety. 
 Euralarm concluded by encouraging policymakers to strengthen compliance efforts and work with industry groups to achieve these goals. 
 Euralarm supports EU e-commerce regulation for product compliance: Summary 
 Euralarm has responded to the European Commission’s Communication on E-Commerce. 
 The organisation said it supports the technical approach proposed to ensure fair competition and consumer safety. 
 Euralarm reported that low-cost, non-compliant imports pose safety and cybersecurity risks. 
 It said these risks are increasing due to the growth of online marketplaces. 
 The organisation called for stricter enforcement of EU regulations, including the DSA, DMA, CRA and GPSR. 
 It stated that market surveillance must be strengthened to prevent unsafe products from reaching European consumers. 
 Euralarm said regulatory enforcement is needed to protect businesses that comply with EU standards. 
 It explained that stronger rules will help maintain trust in safety and security technologies. 
 The organisation expressed support for the European Commission’s efforts to address these challenges. 
 It urged collaboration between industry and regulators to advance compliance and protect public safety.
