# EU Antitrust Regulators To Decide On Mars' Kellanova Deal By 25 June

European Union antitrust regulators will decide by 25 June whether to clear Mars' $36 billion (€32.1 billion) takeover of Pringles maker Kellanova, according to a European Commission filing. 
 Family-owned candy giant Mars  announced the deal in August last year that will bring together brands from M&amp;M's and Snickers to Pringles and Pop-Tarts under one roof. 
 The US packaged food sector is experiencing a wave of consolidation as companies seek scale to weather the impact of inflation-weary consumers cutting back and shifting their purchases to private label brands. 
 The EU antitrust enforcer can clear the deal with or without remedies during its preliminary review or it can open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns. 
 The companies are seeking to close the deal by August this year but could extend the deadline by up to 12 months if they do not receive the necessary regulatory approvals by then. 
 Regulatory Scrutiny 
 The deal should be able to withstand regulatory scrutiny due to limited overlaps between the companies, legal experts said. 
 Media reports suggest that some European retailers have raised concerns with the Commission, which may prompt demands for concessions but not derail the deal. 
 Pringles maker  Kellanova  missed market expectations for first-quarter net sales, as consumer spending weakened in the company's biggest market due to inflation. 
 In August of last year, legal experts said Mars' contemplated acquisition of US snack maker Kellanova stands a good chance of getting past global antitrust regulators, even as it touches on a sensitive area of government oversight.
