# All EU members classified as 'low risk' under anti-deforestation rules

All 27 EU countries have dodged the “high risk” label under the bloc's own anti-deforestation regulation, in a long-awaited classification unveiled by the European Commission today.

The benchmarking is part of the implementation of the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which ranks countries as high, standard, or low risk. The category determines how strict due diligence rules will be for companies – which also means more checks – on those importing crucial agri-food commodities like cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil and beef.

The low-risk category includes countries such as the United States, China, Australia and Canada. Those that will be labelled "high risk" are Belarus, Myanmar, North Korea and Russia, as first reported by Euractiv. The rest are in the standard category.

Even before its presentation, the proposed classification caused diplomatic tensions with some trade partners, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil – major exporters of many of the affected products.

Reactions from Malaysia were quick to arrive, with criticism focusing on the fact that all EU member states are classified in the lowest risk category, which is seen as "favouritism".

"The European Commission knows that we have a far better record on this than some European states," said Dato' Carl Bek-Nielsen, chariman of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council/

"And yet the European Commission has rewarded its own members with ‘low risk’ status. This apparent favouritism will inevitably cause resentment instead of building bridges for closer cooperation.”

Luciana Téllez Chávez, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that although Malaysia’s deforestation rate has lowered, the human rights risks remain extremely high. "Indigenous peoples’ territories are still being logged and encroached upon without their consent," she added.

For NGO Mighty Earth's policy director, Julian Oram, the low-risk category is also too generous. He slammed as "nonsensical" the classification of countries such as Canada, Ghana, Papua New Guinea and Romania as low-risk, given the evidence of deforestation and forest degradation.

However, despite the different categories, all countries are expected to comply with the regulation and demonstrate, using geolocation coordinates, that forests have not been cleared to produce the imported goods.

"Today's publication of the country benchmarking is an important milestone ahead of the entry into application of the law on 30 December 2025 for large companies and 30 June 2026 for micro- and small enterprises," said the Commission in a press release.
