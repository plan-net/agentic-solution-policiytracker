# Tariff wars - how e-commerce firms can ride out a trade war, according to Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah

The potential impact of US tariffs on the e-commerce industry is not a new topic. Back during Trump 1.0, the likes of Alibaba were warning Washington that a trade war would hurt it more than online retailers and marketplace providers.

The potential impact of US tariffs on the e-commerce industry is not a new topic. Back during Trump 1.0, the likes of Alibaba were warning Washington that a trade war would hurt it more than online retailers and marketplace providers.  
 Flash forward to 2025 and China faces the toughest of the Trump 2.0 tariffs and once again, given the supply chain dependence so many retailers, online and offline, have here for sourcing, questions are once more being asked about what the knock-on effects might be. 
 Online furniture retailer Wayfair hasn’t had its problems to look for in recent times. It was among those who ‘had a good pandemic’ as sales boomed during lockdowns around the world and people stuck at home upgraded their domestic office spaces and beyond. But in the Vaccine Economy, Wayfair has had a bumpier time of it with declining revenues and losses. 
 So the last thing you’d think think it needs right now is the prospect of being caught in the crossfire of a new trade war. In fact, CEO Niraj Shah seems remarkably phlegmatic in his reaction, arguing: 
 Tariffs are not a new phenomenon in our category. Going back to the early 2000s, a number of Chinese producers were hit with anti-dumping duties on wood furniture products, some of which were over 50%, which began a migration of production out of China. In 2019, a 25% duty was implemented more broadly on home furnishings products, and that never went away. 
 
 Learnings  
 That being the case, Wayfair can provide others with insights and learnings into how to navigate such headwinds, he argues: 
 At the most basic, we operate a platform that connects over 20,000 suppliers to our more than 20 million customers. Our retail platform delivers for the customer by facilitating marketplace dynamics where a supplier competes with other suppliers to win each order and they do that by offering the best value. Value can come in many dimensions in this category, breadth of assortment, quality, speed of delivery, and price being a few.  
 Like other retail channels, our platform allows our suppliers to choose the wholesale price they want to charge us and we layer a take rate on top of that for our retail price. Suppliers who offer a more competitive wholesale price often succeed on the storefront because that translates directly into more competitive retail prices for customers. So when an incremental cost like a tariff enters the system, suppliers have to make a decision on how much they want to pass through versus bearing themselves. 
 
 This is where the marketplace-like forces on the platform work most in Wayfair’s favor, he suggests: 
 The category we operate in is largely unbranded and highly substitutable. On top of that, we have thousands of partners selling through Wayfair, which means that there is intense competition amongst our suppliers to win each order.  Just as we're seeing now, back then there was a lot of speculation about how much tariffs would ultimately increase retail prices. 
 It's important to remember that the tariff is applied to the value of the goods at the time of import, which is a fraction of our wholesale price. There are multiple companies who participate in the value chain and the burden of the tariff can be shared across that group. In 2019, we saw this playing out in real time. Suppliers that found a way to keep wholesale costs low were the most successful. They could often make up the margin difference with the volume gains by taking share from their peers that chose to pass the cost burden through. 
 
 This creates a very clear incentive structure for suppliers to offer their best prices at all times, says Shah: 
 That incentive has only grown more powerful in the years since as we have grown the global base of suppliers and we have provided them with increasingly powerful tools to manage their business. All of this, combined with the prolonged contraction in category demand, has only served to further elevate competition amongst suppliers for each customer order. 
 
 Size matters 
 Being able to be agile is also important. Shah explains: 
 We are frequently asked what the mix of sourcing by country looks like. Our platform has considerable diversity and sourcing can shift in a very dynamic fashion based on which suppliers have the most compelling offering to consumers at any one point in time. This is an important facet not all investors appreciate. When suppliers in one region raise prices, we may see consumer demand quickly shift to suppliers in another region if they have a more competitive offering. Many of our largest suppliers have manufacturing capabilities spread across multiple countries and can pivot production lines as the cost equation shifts. 
 
 And size matters, he adds: 
 Our scale gives us a durable competitive advantage here. We can drive healthy competition across our thousands of suppliers in a category that, as I mentioned a moment ago, has vast assortment and high substitutability. We have suppliers that manufacture in over 100 countries across the world, including a substantial base of production that is done domestically. Across dozens of our top classes, such as area rugs, beds, dining chairs, end tables, and more, we have thousands of items made in the US. These products come from the thousands of our suppliers that manufacture here in the States. Overall, our wide breadth of products and supply base from around the globe continues to offer us a healthy degree of insulation against tariff headlines. 
 
 Shah says that Wayfair is trying to provide as much as assistance to its own suppliers as possible in the face of the putative trade wars ramping up: 
 I've personally spoken with a broad range of suppliers in the past month. They're pragmatic and resilient. Many of these are businesses that have operated for decades through both booms and busts. Each conversation turns to how Wayfair can help support our partners as we have for many years. The first pillar of support we can offer is data, which is how we ground these conversations. Our ability to track spending propensity in real time gives suppliers a clear view of how they can optimize their pricing to maximize their own economics. From there, we get into how they can take advantage of some of the value-added services we offer to drive better unit economics, such as leaning deeper into [Wayfair’s logistics partner] CastleGate to offer faster delivery and lower fulfillment costs, which is directly reflected in lower retail pricing. 
 
 He adds: 
 We share a lot of data on what we're seeing happen on the platform because suppliers realize they may need to raise prices at some point. But again, they don't want to raise them earlier or larger than competitors do. So they want to know kind of what's happening on the landscape so that they can try their best to stay very competitive. We basically do try to provide them with some direction and guidance and share the landscape with them. 
 
 So given the way that landscape looks at present, what is Shah’s overall feeling about what happens next? He’s cautious in his assessment: 
 It's a pretty dynamic environment right now because, obviously, there's a 10% base tariff. talking about non-China, and then there's the varying degrees of reciprocal tariffs. The reciprocal tariffs are what have been paused for 90 days, and then China has a different whole set of things. So to try to project exactly how this will all net out, because there's been talks of discussions, negotiations underway with India and with South Korea and with Vietnam and with a whole host of countries and to project exactly how they play out, it's difficult. 
 
 My take 
 Just to be clear, I'm not saying that we benefit from tariffs.  
 
 Indeed, no. And, of course, that’s the big question - who does? From President Trump’s point of view, China and other exporting nations are going to carry the cost of the tariffs themselves and the levys won’t be reflected in the retail prices in the shops. The CEOs of the likes of Target and Walmart reckon otherwise and appear to have told him so, with the prospect of empty shelves in the stores seemingly contributing to the current 90 day interregnum. But the clock is ticking down…
