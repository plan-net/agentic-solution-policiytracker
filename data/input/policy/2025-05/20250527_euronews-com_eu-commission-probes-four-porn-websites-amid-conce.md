 11:52 ADVERTISEMENT The European Commission has begun investigating porn platforms Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos for suspected breaches of the Digital Services Act (DSA) the EU’s online platform rules, related to protection of minors. These include risks that age verification measures deployed by the sites are ineffective. The Commission has already found on the basis of mandatory reports and requests for information that the companies didn't put appropriate and proportionate measures in place to ensure a high level of privacy, safety and security for minors, in particular with age verification tools to safeguard minors from adult content.  Nor did the sites carry out risk assessments or mitigate for negative effects on the rights of children, or use appropriate age verification tools to prevent minors from accessing adult content, the Commission said. Protecting young users online is one of the key enforcement priorities under the DSA. The Commission has launched several probes into protection of minors under the platform rules, including into Meta’s Facebook and Instagram.  The DSA entered into force for the first batch of the largest online platforms in 2023, including Facebook, TikTok, X and Amazon. The Commission brought porn platforms under the ambit of the rules which affect very large online platforms (or VLOPS) after they broke the threshold of 45 million average monthly users. It currently designates 25 platforms as VLOPs, and has also begun investigating breaches of the DSA by Temu, X, TikTok and Meta. None of the probes have been wrapped up yet. The EU executive said Stripchat will not anymore be designated as a VLOP after providing user numbers that are below the threshold. The decision applies in four months. For the probes it began on Tuesday, the Commission worked together with the member states, through the European Board for Digital Services, which together launched a coordinated action to protect minors as regards pornographic content on smaller platforms. The national authorities are responsible for overseeing all the companies that fall below the 45 million average monthly user thresholds. The probes could be further expanded with other elements under the DSA, in the course of the investigation. Earlier this month, the Commission launched a public consultation on its draft guidelines on the protection of minors online, aimed to help online platforms to ensure a high level of privacy, safety and security for children online.
