The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has revealed adjustments to the market lot sizes for derivative contracts associated with specific indices. The changes, effective 25 April 2025, will affect traders and investors involved in Nifty Bank and Nifty Mid Select index derivatives.    With the update, the lot size for Bank Nifty will go up from 30 to 35, and the lot size for Midcap Nifty will increase from 120 to 140. NSE stated in a note on March 28 that the lot sizes for major indices such as Nifty 50, Nifty Financial Services, and Nifty Next 50 stay the same.    The updated lot sizes will take effect for new contracts beginning with the July 2025 expiry, whereas existing contracts that expire in April, May, and June 2025 will maintain their present lot sizes. Furthermore, all quarterly contracts that can be traded from April 25, 2025, onwards will show the revised lot sizes, the NSE statement also mentioned.    Derivatives are financial agreements whose worth is based on an underlying asset, like a stock index, a commodity, or a currency. Futures and Options (F&amp;O) are the most widely used derivatives, enabling traders to bet on price changes or mitigate risks without having direct ownership of the asset.    A lot size indicates the smallest quantity of units that must be purchased or sold in one derivative agreement. As derivatives are leveraged tools, traders aren't obliged to pay the complete contract value upfront, although the lot size dictates their exposure and the necessary margin.  The day spread order book will be unavailable for the May 2025 – July 2025 and June 2025 – July 2025 combination contracts to ensure a seamless transition.
