Carrefour Global Sourcing (CGS), part of the Carrefour S.A. Group, will support its responsible sourcing initiatives with the TradeBeyond CBX platform, which is designed to strengthen supplier management and improve risk assessment and auditing to help ensure compliance with Europe’s sustainability laws. Carrefour operates more than 14,000 hypermarkets, grocery stores and convenience stores around the globe. 
 CGS will implement the TradeBeyond solutions to manage its non-food products supplier base, using their supplier portal and supply chain mapping tools to: 
 
 Help onboard new vendors more efficiently; 
 Conduct in-depth supplier screenings; 
 Digitize contracts; 
 Manage all compliance documents; and 
 Monitor adherence to key ESG (environmental, social and governance) and social compliance standards. 
 
 Additionally, Carrefour will use TradeBeyond sustainability tools such as lifecycle assessment (LCA) to gain deeper insights into product specification and bill of materials used. 
 “Carrefour is deeply committed to sustainability, and partnering with TradeBeyond allows us to take that commitment even further by introducing advanced digital oversight into all tiers of our supply chain,” said Jean-Daniel Gatignol, Managing Director at Carrefour Global Sourcing in a statement. “With TradeBeyond’s multi-enterprise platform, we can reduce compliance risks while ensuring our sourcing operations align with consumer expectations.” 
 In October 2023 Party City implemented a TradeBeyond supply chain solution, and in June 2024 Walgreens Boots Alliance deployed a platform from TradeBeyond to manage several of its global sourcing processes.
