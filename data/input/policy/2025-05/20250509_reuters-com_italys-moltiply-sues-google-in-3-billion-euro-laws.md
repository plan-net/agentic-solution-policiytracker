Its claim argues that Google's actions hindered the growth of its subsidiary 7Pixel between 2010 and 2017, favouring Google Shopping instead, Moltiply said in a statement. The claim was filed at a Milan court, Italian daily Corriere della Sera said without giving further details.

The European Commission fined Google, the world's most popular internet search engine, in 2017 for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals. In September, the company lost a final appeal against the 2.42 billion euro fine. "The changes Google made in 2017 following the European Commissionâ€™s decision are working as intended and the number of comparison shopping sites in Europe using our shopping features has multiplied from just 7 to more than 1,550", the Google spokesperson added.
