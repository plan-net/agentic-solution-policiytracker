North and South America Jurisdiction 
 1 .Oklahoma and Alabama Move Toward Comprehensive Privacy Laws 
 Date: April 24, 2025 
 State: Oklahoma; Alabama, United States 
 Oklahoma’s Senate Bill 546 is advancing through the legislative process, proposing a new privacy framework for businesses that handle large volumes of personal data. This bill would grant consumers rights to access, delete, and opt out, while requiring companies to limit data use, boost transparency, and assess risks. If enacted, the law is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. 
 Meanwhile, Alabama’s House Bill 283 also moved forward, establishing similar consumer rights and obligations for businesses. If passed, it would take effect on October 1, 2025, and would make Alabama another state adopting a comprehensive privacy framework. 
 Businesses operating in either Oklahoma or Alabama should monitor developments closely and prepare for stricter privacy compliance obligations in these states. Read more on Oklahoma’s SB 456 and Alabama’s HB 283. 
 2. Montana Passes Amendments to Consumer Data Privacy Law 
 Date: April 22, 2025 
 State: Montana, United States 
 Montana’s SB 297 that amends the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA) is signed by the President and now awaits signature by the Montana governor. 
 The bill significantly enhances privacy rights, particularly for minors. It prohibits the sale, profiling, or targeted advertising of known minors' data and mandates reasonable safeguards against harm. It also expands applicability by lowering thresholds for covered entities and introducing stricter rules on privacy notices, opt-outs, and data collection practices. 
 Furthermore, it eliminates the 60-day cure period and grants the Attorney General enforcement powers, including civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation. It also allows for mandatory data protection assessments where there is heightened risk, especially involving minors. 
 Organizations operating in Montana should prepare now for these substantial changes. Read More 
 3. Montana Moves to Expand Privacy Law to Cover Neural Data 
 Date: April 22, 2025 
 State: Montana, United States 
 Montana’s Senate Bill 163, amending the Montana Genetic Information Privacy Act (MGIPA), was transmitted to the governor on April 22, 2025. If signed, Montana would become the third U.S. state to enact a law protecting neural neurotechnology data. 
 The bill expands privacy protection to neural data recognizing it as sensitive personal information. It requires explicit consent before collecting or sharing neural information, blocks unauthorized access by insurers, employers, or even government agencies without a warrant, and bans offshoring neural data to sanctioned countries. Companies must now disclose exactly how they collect, use, and store neurotechnology data and consumers can demand its deletion or destruction. 
 Montana’s move highlights growing concerns about cognitive privacy as neurotechnology becomes more commercially widespread. Read More 
 4. FTC Publishes Final Amendments to COPPA Rule 
 Date: April 22, 2025 
 Country: United States 
 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has finalized significant amendments to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Rule (COPPA), published in the Federal Register on April 22, 2025. The new Rule becomes effective June 23, 2025, with a compliance deadline of April 22, 2026. 
 The amendments expand the scope of personal information protected under the COPPA Rule, now including biometric identifiers and government-issued IDs. They introduce enhanced parental consent requirements, stricter privacy notice obligations, mandatory data retention policies, and requirements for written information security programs. Operators must now obtain separate verifiable parental consent for disclosing children's personal information to third parties not integral to their services 
 The FTC’s action highlights the increasing regulatory focus on children’s online privacy, emphasizing that compliance with both federal and emerging state-level protections is essential. 
 If your organization operates websites, apps, or online services directed at children under 13, immediate steps toward updating your compliance frameworks are recommended. Read more 
 5. Oregon Advances Bill to Ban Sale of Geolocation and Teen Data 
 Date: April 21, 2025 
 State: Oregon, United States 
 Oregon’s amended HB 2008 has cleared the House and referred to the Senate Committee on Judiciary. The Bill is set for public hearing on May 5, 2025. 
 HB 2008 proposes key updates to the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA). If enacted, the bill would prohibit the sale of personal data or its use for targeted advertising or profiling when the controller knows or willfully disregards that the user is under 16. 
 It would also ban the sale of precise geolocation data capable of identifying a user’s location within 1,750 feet, citing risks of surveillance, stalking, and intrusive tracking. 
 The bill reflects growing U.S. legislative momentum around teen protections and sensitive data. Organizations operating in Oregon will need to review consent practices and geolocation-based offerings for compliance. 
 6. Arkansas Enacts Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act 
 Date: April 21, 2025 
 State: Arkansas, United States 
 Arkansas has officially enacted HB 1717 as Act 952, establishing one of the most comprehensive privacy laws in the U.S. for minors online. The law applies to operators of websites, apps, and digital services directed at or knowingly collecting data from children under 13 and teens aged 13-16. 
 The law mandates strict data minimization, limits retention, prohibits targeted advertising without consent, and grants rights to access, delete, and correct data. It requires verifiable parental consent for processing children's data and, for teens, mandates either teen or parental consent unless the processing falls under seven permitted exceptions (e.g., fraud prevention, internal operations). 
 Unlike COPPA, the law extends protections to teens without requiring mandatory age verification. It will be enforced exclusively by the Arkansas Attorney General and takes effect on July 1, 2026. 
 Organizations offering online services to minors in Arkansas should start preparing now for significant compliance changes. Read more

 10. CPPA &amp; NJAG Urge A Federal Data Privacy Framework 
 Date: April 7, 2025 
 Country: United States 
 The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) and the New Jersey Attorney General (NJAG) have submitted a joint letter to the U.S. House Committee on Energy &amp; Commerce’s Privacy Working Group, calling for a strong federal data privacy framework that sets a floor not a ceiling for protections. 
 The letter stresses that a federal law should preserve states' rights to enact stronger safeguards, highlighting the crucial role states have played in driving innovation in privacy protections. It also calls for transparency and accountability in AI-driven decision-making and urges Congress to incorporate state enforcement powers into any federal privacy regime. 
 The move reflects growing state-led momentum to ensure that evolving federal efforts build on  rather than weaken the privacy protections Americans already rely on. Read More 
 11. Bermuda Clarifies Age Assurance Obligations Under PIPA 
 Date: April 3, 2025 
 Country: Bermuda 
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Bermuda (PrivCom) has published a blog on age assurance methods under the Personal Information Protection Act 2016 (PIPA). Organizations must now verify if users are under 14 and get parental consent before collecting children's data. 
 PrivCom outlines methods like self-declared ages, document checks, facial estimation, email analysis, and payment verification. No single solution fits all, and organizations are urged to prioritize privacy-enhancing technologies and follow Privacy by Design principles. 
 This update follows Bermuda’s endorsement of a joint international statement on age assurance and aims to help organizations better comply with children’s data protections under PIPA.

 13. UK’s Ofcom Publishes Draft Protection of Children Codes To Enhance Children’s Safety Online 
 Date: April 24, 2025 
 Country: United Kingdom 
 The UK’s Office of Communication (Ofcom) has published its draft Protection of Children Codes setting out the safety standards digital services must meet to protect children under the Online Safety Act. 
 The Codes apply to user-to-user and search services likely to be accessed by children. Key requirements include conducting risk assessments, implementing age assurance measures, moderating harmful content like suicide, pornography, or abuse, and ensuring clear reporting and complaints procedures. 
 Services posing greater risks or with large UK user bases (7 million+) will face stricter obligations, including annual risk reviews and enhanced content controls. Providers may adopt Ofcom’s recommended measures or alternative ones, as long as they document how those fulfil their legal duties. 
 Organizations with online services accessible to children in the UK should proactively familiarize themselves with Ofcom's draft Protection of Children Codes and strategically plan for the implementation of necessary safeguards in anticipation of the Codes' expected parliamentary approval on July 25, 2025.

 14. France Launches Consultation on Multi-Terminal Consent Collection 
 Date: April 24, 2025 
 Country: France 
 The French data protection authority, CNIL, has opened a public consultation on its draft recommendation for collecting multi-terminal consent i.e., cookie and tracker consent that applies across all devices linked to a user account. 
 The draft focuses on “logged-in universes” and outlines GDPR-compliant ways for organizations to collect a single consent that would automatically apply across smartphones, tablets, laptops, smart TVs, and browsers provided they are connected to the same user account. 
 The recommendation aims to support digital stakeholders (e.g., publishers and ad tech providers) in improving consent experiences while meeting legal standards. It supplements CNIL’s 2020 guidance on cookies and trackers. 
 The consultation is open until June 5, 2025. 
 If your organization navigates multi-terminal user consent, we encourage you to review CNIL's draft recommendation on multi-terminal consent and participate in the public consultation to help achieve a final version of the recommendation. Read More 
 15. The European Commission Fines Apple and Meta Under Digital Markets Act for Non-Compliance 
 Date: April 23, 2025 
 The European Commission has fined Apple €500 million and Meta €200 million for breaching the Digital Markets Act (DMA) owing to their restrictive practices and non-compliant advertising models, respectively. 
 Apple was penalized for preventing app developers from informing users about alternative, cheaper purchasing options outside the App Store violating DMA anti-steering provisions. The Commission has ordered Apple to remove these restrictions. 
 Meta’s earlier “Consent or Pay” model- which required users to either consent to personalized ad tracking or pay for an ad-free service was found non-compliant, as it failed to offer an equivalent, less intrusive alternative. The fine applies to the period before Meta introduced a revised model in November 2024. 
 Both companies must comply with the decisions within 60 days or face further penalties. 
 The ruling signals strict enforcement of the DMA and a clear warning for businesses operating in the EU to ensure compliance with user choice and transparency obligations. Read More 
 16. EU-Canada Agreement Finalized on Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data

 18. EU Signals GDPR Simplification for SMEs 
 Date: April 14, 2025 
 European Commissioner for Justice Michael McGrath has confirmed that the European Commission plans to simplify the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly to reduce burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The confirmation came during a livestreamed interview as part of the “ Future of Transatlantic Digital Collaboration ” event hosted by CSIS. 
 The simplification will focus on easing record-keeping obligations for businesses with fewer than 500 employees, while maintaining the GDPR’s core principles. This initiative is part of a broader “Digital Package” anticipated in Q4 2025, which aims to streamline various pieces of EU digital legislation, including the GDPR, Cybersecurity Act, and the AI Act. The move aligns with the Commission’s 2025 Work Programme and its Competitiveness Compass goals to reduce administrative burdens and improve legal coherence across digital laws. 
 If your organization is an SME operating in the EU, this upcoming simplification could reduce compliance overhead, but core data protection obligations will remain unchanged. Read More 
 19. European Commission Proposes First-Ever Adequacy Decision for European Patent Organization 
 Date: April 5, 2025 
 The European Commission has launched the process to adopt an EU adequacy decision for the European Patent Organization (EPO)- marking the first time such a decision has been proposed for an international organization under GDPR. 
 The draft decision concludes that EPO’s data protection framework provides a level of protection essentially equivalent to that of the EU. Once adopted, it would allow EU-based entities to transfer personal data to the EPO without the need for additional safeguards, supporting smoother cross-border data flows in the patent ecosystem. 
 This would ease GDPR compliance for data transfers to the EPO, especially for innovation and IP-driven businesses operating across borders. Read More
