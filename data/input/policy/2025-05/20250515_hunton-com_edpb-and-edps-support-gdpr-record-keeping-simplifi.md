# EDPB and EDPS Support GDPR Record-Keeping Simplification Proposal

On May 8, 2025, the European Data Protection Board (“EDPB”) and the European Data Protection Supervisor (“EDPS”) adopted a joint letter addressed to the European Commission regarding the upcoming proposal to simplify record-keeping obligations under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). This proposal aims to amend Article 30(5) of the GDPR, simplifying the record-keeping requirements and reducing administrative burdens while maintaining robust data protection standards. 
 The European Commission proposed the following changes to Article 30(5) of the GDPR: 
 
 Exemptions for Small Mid-Cap Companies: Extending the derogation which currently applies to enterprises or organizations with fewer than 250 employees (including small and medium-sized enterprises or SMEs), to also cover “small mid-cap companies,” i.e., companies with fewer than 500 employees and with a defined annual turnover, as well as organizations such as non-profits with fewer than 500 employees. 
 Expansion of Application: Modifying the derogation so it would not apply if the processing is “likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,” as opposed to the current provision, which only mentions processing likely to result in a “risk,” therefore broadening the ability to use the derogation. 
 Limiting Record-Keeping Exceptions: Removing certain exceptions to the record-keeping derogation, including references to occasional processing and possibly special categories of data. 
 Employment, Social Security or Social Protection Law Exception: Introducing a recital clarifying that the obligation to maintain records of processing activities would not apply to the processing of special categories of data to comply with legal obligations in the field of employment, social security or social protection law in accordance with Article 9(2)(b) of the GDPR. 
 
 In their joint letter, the EDPB and EDPS express “preliminary support to this targeted simplification initiative,” noting that they support the retention of a risk-based approach in respect of processing, and observing that “even very small companies can still engage in high-risk processing.” Both parties welcome the opportunity for a formal consultation to take place after the publication of the draft legislative change.
