A German data protection authority has instructed Meta to halt all AI training using the data of European users. 
 
 Last month, Meta announced its new standalone ChatGPT rival Meta AI, which differentiates itself from other AI chatbots like ChatGPT and DeepSeek by drawing on information it already knows about users through their social media accounts for years and years. 
 “We’re using our decades of work personalising people’s experiences on our platforms to make Meta AI more personal. You can tell Meta AI to remember certain things about you (like that you love to travel and learn new languages), and it can also pick up important details based on context,” said Meta.

“Your Meta AI assistant also delivers more relevant answers to your questions by drawing on information you’ve already chosen to share on Meta products, like your profile, and content you like or engage with.” 
 
 The move drew major controversy from experts and governments alike for the security and privacy issues that using harvested data from people’s Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp could create. 
 Privacy regulators from Belgium, France, and the Netherlands have already found issue with the new AI and warned users to restrict data access before the company begins the training on 27 May as part of its new privacy policy by objecting through Meta’s website. 
 Now, the Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), a regional German data protection authority, has ordered Meta to halt the training altogether, sending the company a cease and desist letter, which will follow legal action if Meta doesn’t cooperate. 
 
 NRW data protection expert Christine Steffen said that action needs to be taken before it’s too late. 
 “It’s urgent, because all the data that has been incorporated into the AI ​​is difficult to retrieve,” said Steffen. 
 The NRW also argues that Meta falsely claims to care about the use of European data and that users should have a say in how their data is used. 
 “Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that particularly sensitive information, which is specially protected under the General Data Protection Regulation, is also used for AI training purposes,” said Steffen. 
 “In this case, a so-called opt-out – as offered by Meta – is not sufficient; those affected would have to actively consent to this.” 
 RMIT Professor of Business Analytics Kok-Leong Ong highlighted Meta’s decision to train AI on social media user data as the potential for major security risks. 
 “Meta already has a huge amount of information about its users. Its new AI app could pose security and privacy issues. Users will need to navigate potentially confusing settings and user agreements,” said Ong. 
 “They will need to choose between safeguarding their data versus the experience they get from using the AI agent. Conversely, imposing tight security and privacy settings on Meta may impact the effectiveness of its AI agent.” 
 Ong also warns that AI powered by social media could expand the spread of misinformation and harmful content. 
 “We have already seen Mark Zuckerberg apologise to families whose children were harmed by using social media. 
 “AI agents working in a social context could heighten a user’s exposure to misinformation and inappropriate content. This could lead to mental health issues and fewer in-person social interactions,” said Ong. 
 Alongside amplifying misinformation, social media AI trends, such as the recent Barbie doll trend, may also be intensified by social media-fed AI. 
 Chairman of the Austrian privacy advocacy group Noyb, Max Schrems, has also shown support for the decision to ban Meta’s AI training of European users. 
 “Meta is deliberately trying to ignore European law and is putting its commercial interests above the fundamental right to data protection of those affected,” he said. 
 “The laws apply throughout Europe, and we support the initiative of the Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia 100 per cent. 
 “Meta should simply ask the affected people for their consent. But if Meta ignores EU law, there will be consequences for the whole of Europe.”
