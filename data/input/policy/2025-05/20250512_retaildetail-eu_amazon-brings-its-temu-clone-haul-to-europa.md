Amazon is bringing the fight Temu to Europe: customers in the United Kingdom will be the first Europeans to have access to its cheap Chinese goods platform Haul. 
 European rollout expected this year 
 Haul is Amazon’s answer to the growing market share of platforms such as Temu and Shein, which are quickly gaining ground with dirt-cheap products and flash deals. Haul offers a wide range in categories like fashion, home and lifestyle, with most products costing less than ten dollars. This is possible because the products are shipped directly from China, which on the other hand means that delivery times are longer (about two weeks) than is typically the case with Amazon. 
 The new service is currently available as a trial for a selected customer base in the United Kingdom. The full roll-out is expected within a few weeks. Amazon has been testing the concept in the United States since last November and sees it as a core part of its global growth strategy for 2025. Although Amazon has not yet released concrete dates, various media reports indicate that Haul may also launch in the rest of Europe by the end of this year.
