Alphabet Inc.’s Google is facing at least €12 billion ($13.3 billion) in damage claims from dozens of price comparison websites across the European Union which allege that the search and advertising giant stole their customers, according to a Bloomberg News review. The civil suits are linked to a 2017 decision by the European Commission to fine Google €2.4 billion for illegally leveraging its search dominance to give its own shopping service an edge. That unleashed a wave of so-called “follow-on” suits, which were delayed for years as Google appealed. Then, last year, a tribunal confirmed that the company did violate antitrust laws — meaning EU-based plaintiffs no longer have to prove that in court. Many of the cases are now moving ahead.
