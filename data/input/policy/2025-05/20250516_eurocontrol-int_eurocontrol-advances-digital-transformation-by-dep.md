EUROCONTROL has taken another major step forward in its digital transformation journey with the successful start of operations of the enhanced European Aeronautical Information Services Database (eEAD). eEAD is a state-of-the-art service that gives its users access to the most up-to-date aeronautical information in the world, offering airlines a real-time overview of changes to and in the network, helping them to file accurate flight plans, improve efficiency, and reduce delays. 
 
 The European aviation network is a complex structure of routes, sectors and ground infrastructure that changes on a daily basis. More than 60 States provide aeronautical information to eEAD and over 200 data users access the system to consult pre-flight information allowing flight operations personnel to adequately prepare for the flight and to acquire current NOTAM information of operational significance and to submit their flight plans, prior to the start of a flight. The new Digital NOTAM introduces a structured, machine-readable format that transforms how critical aeronautical information updates are managed. Due to the automated processing, advanced filtering, and intuitive visualisation operational stakeholders can now quickly identify infrastructure changes and events, which supports safer and more efficient decision-making. EAD data providers are progressively transitioning to the new system. 
 The new system is part of EUROCONTROL’s digital transformation programme, known as iNM – integrated Network Management. This is set to replace the organisation’s legacy operational systems with advanced digital products, modernising European air traffic management (ATM) to deal with the capacity challenge by enhancing the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of the European aviation network. This latest (Wave 2) iNM release follows on the release of EUROCONTROL’s brand-new digital platform - the foundation of our new operational systems; three Digital Products launched in October, and the launch of eEAD shadow operations for early adopters.

“The go live of eEAD is a pivotal milestone in EUROCONTROLs digital transformation journey. Built in close cooperation with our technology partners, Indra and ATOS, and based on the eEAD ConOps developed with the users, eEAD offers the first yet important increment of a smarter, more efficient daily data management as well as Digital NOTAM operations. The new eEAD is compliant with European and ICAO rules for safe, efficient and sustainable air traffic operations, ensuring our aeronautical data management is fit for future.”

EUROCONTROL is partnering with Indra, ATOS, Microsoft, MongoDB and others on eEAD and the digital platform on which all new iNM solutions will be hosted. 
 Commenting on the deployment of eEAD Phase 1 of the iNM programme, the third major programme deliverable, Victor Martínez, Executive Vice President of ATM at Indra said:

“This crucial milestone achieved today by EUROCONTROL is a huge step forward on the path towards the digitalisation of the systems that manage air traffic in Europe. We are very proud to be part of the development of the new capabilities within the iNM programme, which ensure that the solutions managing aeronautical data meet the present and future needs of aviation, and to contribute with our technological expertise to the transformation of aeronautical data management, shaping the Single European Sky”.

“Atos is proud to be one of the main organisations partnering with EUROCONTROL to help it achieve its ambition of transforming its mission critical systems within the iNM programme. This transformation is essential to support future air traffic volumes across Europe and the globe. The release of eEAD is a pivotal moment on that journey whereby 60 states will use this system to deliver a more efficient and safe air traffic management across its network. Atos expertise in cloud design and orchestration, testing and system integration, data &amp; security as well as end to end operations was a key enabler in this success.”

Taking advantage of Microsoft Azure cloud services iNM products have the ability to scale resources based on demand, with increased resilience and robust security for mission-critical applications and services. iNM will run across multiple regions within Azure’s EU Data Boundary.

“At Microsoft, we are proud to support EUROCONTROL’s digital transformation journey with the deployment of the enhanced eEAD. This milestone showcases the impact of cloud innovation in modernizing mission-critical infrastructure, ensuring resilience, scalability and security at the heart of European aviation. By leveraging the trusted power of Microsoft Azure, we’re enabling EUROCONTROL and its stakeholders to access, process and act on real-time data faster and more efficiently. Helping shape a safer, smarter and more sustainable air traffic network,”

MongoDB is supporting EUROCONTROL with de-risk implementations and accelerating business outcomes. 
 eEAD Phase 1 is providing solutions to EAD Service clients supporting them in their compliance with Common Project One (CP1) - the EU Regulation that outlines six essential air traffic management (ATM) functionalities that must be implemented across the European ATM Network to modernise and harmonise air traffic operations across Europe focusing on safety, efficiency and environmental sustainability. 
 Next steps 
Following the launch of this week’s Wave 2 EUROCONTROL will continue its work on subsequent phases of the iNM programme, including the next and final increment of eEAD. The next milestone will be Wave 2.1 that is going to introduce Trajectory Management Phase 1, integrating flight plan and flow management systems to enhance the precision and flexibility of air traffic management as well as the introduction of the new NM User Interface (NMUI), the one stop-shop access to NM services &amp; products. Wave 2.2 (eEAD Phase 2) will deliver all eEAD capabilities enabling EAD Service clients to migrate to eEAD, and to start the gradual decommissioning of the legacy EAD system. 
By the end of the decade, the iNM programme will have revolutionised the EUROCONTROL Network Manager’s operational systems, introducing a powerful, scalable, and integrated digital architecture that will drive greater efficiency, safety, and sustainability across the European aviation network.
