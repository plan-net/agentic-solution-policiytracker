 New EU Regulation 2025/40 (PPWR) sets strict limits on PFAS in food packaging from August 2026, aiming to reduce environmental and health risks. 
The European Union has adopted Regulation 2025/40, introducing strict limits on PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in food packaging and reduces single-use plastic in fresh produce and food services, pushing for more recyclable and reusable solutions. The goal is to minimize exposure to harmful substances and reduce environmental impact. 
PFAS are synthetic chemicals known for their persistence in the environment and potential health risks. From August 12, 2026, packaging materials that exceed specific concentration limits of PFAS will no longer be allowed on the EU market. In line with the PPWR, food packaging will be prohibited if it contains PFAS in a concentration equal to or greater than the following limit values: 
 25 ppb for any PFAS as measured with targeted PFAS analysis. 
 250 ppb for the sum of PFAS measured with targeted analysis. 
 50 ppm for PFASs (polymeric PFAS included). If the total fluorine content exceeds 50 mg/kg, additional documentation will be required. 
 
These measures are part of the broader Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR), which seeks to reduce the presence of substances of concern not only in packaging materials but also in emissions and waste residues like ash or recycled raw materials. The regulation supports the EU’s move toward a circular, safer, and more transparent economy. 
This marks a significant step forward in packaging safety and environmental responsibility. Companies will need to adapt their materials and processes to comply with the new standards and meet growing consumer expectations for safer, more sustainable products.
