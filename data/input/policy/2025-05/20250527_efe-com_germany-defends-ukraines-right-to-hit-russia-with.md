Berlin, May 27 (EFE).— German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday defended Ukraine’s right to strike military targets inside Russia using weapons supplied by allies, including Germany, and emphasized the need to prepare for a protracted war, given Moscow’s refusal to consider a ceasefire. 
 “Anyone who only defends themselves on their own territory cannot adequately protect themselves,” Merz said at a joint press conference with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo in the Finnish city of Turku. “Only those who can strike military bases on the aggressor’s territory are truly able to defend themselves.” 
 The conservative German leader said Ukraine had rightly been given this capability “some time ago” to confront Russian aggression effectively. 
 Merz also noted that earlier limitations on the range of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine had been lifted by multiple countries, including Britain, France, the United States, and now Germany, a move he called “necessary.” 
 Speaking at the European Forum hosted by German broadcaster WDR the day before, Merz stated that there are now no restriction on how far Ukraine can use Western-supplied weapons, including against military targets on Russian soil. 
 
 “What I described is something that has been happening for months: Ukraine has the right to use the weapons it receives—even beyond its own borders—against Russian military targets,” he said. 
 “There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine — neither by the British nor by the French nor by us nor by the Americans.” 
 He said it meant that Ukraine could now defend itself “by attacking” Russian military positions. 
 “With very few exceptions, it didn’t do that until recently. It can now do that,” Merz said. 
 The move marks a shift in Germany’s position compared to that of Merz’s predecessor, Olaf Scholz, who had resisted sending long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, fearing it could be seen as Germany’s direct involvement in the war. 
 Merz stressed the importance of closely monitoring not only domestic territory but also developments beyond national borders. 
 “When I say ‘our own,’ I mean primarily NATO territory, but also Ukrainian territory, which we are helping to defend by supporting the Ukrainian army,” he said. 
 The chancellor criticized Moscow’s unwillingness to even consider mediation efforts, such as those offered by the Vatican, as evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no interest in pursuing a ceasefire or peace deal. 
 “As a result, Ukraine must continue to defend itself, and we must step up our efforts to enable that,” Merz said. 
 He warned that the war will likely continue for an extended period, as neither economic nor military exhaustion appears imminent for either side. 
 “But that does not diminish our determination to support Ukraine,” Merz emphasized, adding that Russia remains a threat to the entire European continent. EFE
