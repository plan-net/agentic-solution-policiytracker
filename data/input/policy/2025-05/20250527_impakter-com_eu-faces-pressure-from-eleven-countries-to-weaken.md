 Figures show that 10% of global deforestation is fuelled by EU consumption of imported soy, beef, palm oil amongst other products. The EU’s pioneering deforestation law aims to completely eradicate this percentage as part of its green agenda. The EU is now facing further pressure from eleven member countries to delay and weaken this upcoming law. It has already delayed its launch by a year to December 2025 as trading partners from Brazil and the U.S following complaints. The group of countries have demanded that the EU Commission simplifies its rules further and that the application date is further delayed to implement these changes. Companies and investors can closely monitor these developments and  stay ahead of regulatory shifts using ESG tools.

 Germany’s government has retracted previous statements calling for the EU’s CSDDD (Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive) to be eliminated. The laws according to this directive require that companies address their negative impacts on human rights and the environment across their value chains. The CSDD was initially proposed by the European Commission in February 2022 and its legislation was adopted in May 2024, however multiple revisions meant that the number of companies covered by the laws has significantly reduced. Chancellor Merz’s call to scrap the CSDDD followed a coalition agreement to form a government in Germany in April that also included rollbacks on Germany’s own human rights and environmental supply chain due diligence law. Stefan Kornelius, government spokesperson emphasised that previous comments against the CSDDD were to do with a streamlining of the process towards a sustainable future.

 Despite recent instability in EU-US relations which has had a serious knock-on effect on oil prices, they steadied following Trump’s announcement that he has extended a deadline for trade talks with the EU. Brent crude futures decreased by 17 cents at $64.61 a barrel at 8:35 ET while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude decreased by 18 cents to $61.35 a barrel.
