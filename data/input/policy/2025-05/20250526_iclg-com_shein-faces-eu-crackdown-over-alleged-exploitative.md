From false sales tactics to opaque returns policies, the fast-fashion platform is accused of systematically violating consumer rights across Europe. 
 The controversial online fashion retailer SHEIN – based in Singapore but with its roots firmly planted in China – is facing mounting pressure from European regulators after the European Commission and some member states’ own national consumer authorities jointly accused the platform of widespread violations of EU consumer protection legislation. A coordinated investigation, led by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, has formally notified SHEIN of a range of problematic business practices and ordered the company to bring its operations into compliance without delay. 
 According to yesterday’s (26 May) official announcement, the enforcement action follows an extensive cross-border Commission-coordinated investigation led by national authorities in Belgium, France, Ireland and the Netherlands. Their findings indicate that the Chinese-founded e-commerce retailer is systematically engaging in practices that mislead or exploit consumers who are shopping via its online platform. 
 PRESSURE SELLING 
 According to the CPC Network, SHEIN must urgently address a raft of unlawful tactics, including the use of fake discounts – quoting artificially inflated ‘previous prices’ to suggest greater savings than actually exist. Investigators also condemned the company’s employment of pressure-selling techniques, such as false purchase deadlines or messages implying limited stock, to push consumers towards making rushed purchasing decisions. Other infractions include the provision of misleading or incomplete information regarding consumers’ statutory rights to return goods and receive refunds with SHEIN, in some cases, allegedly failing to process returns in accordance with EU consumer protection rules, leaving customers uncertain about their legal entitlements. 
 GREENWASHING 
 The company is also accused of using deceptive product labels, suggesting that certain product features are special or exclusive when in fact they are mandated by law. Compounding this, the platform has been criticised for making unsubstantiated environmental claims – a practice commonly known as greenwashing. 
 One of the more fundamental issues identified relates to transparency and accessibility. Consumers reportedly face considerable difficulties in reaching customer service or lodging complaints due to the absence of clearly visible contact details. This, the Commission argues, undermines essential protections and leaves consumers without effective recourse when problems arise. 
 As part of its probe, the CPC Network has also demanded further information from SHEIN to assess whether it complies with additional legal obligations. These include ensuring that product rankings, reviews and ratings are presented in a transparent, non-deceptive manner and that consumers are clearly informed when products are sold by third-party sellers. Where such third parties are not recognised traders, consumers may unknowingly waive certain rights, a practice that could potentially amount to a serious breach of EU law. 
 “SHEIN must swiftly bring its practices into conformity with EU consumer protection rules,” said the Commission in a public statement. The company has been given a deadline of just one month to formally respond to the allegations and submit detailed proposals outlining how it intends to address the identified issues. Should SHEIN fail to take adequate action, national authorities within the CPC Network may escalate the matter, including through the imposition of fines based on the company’s turnover within affected member states. 
 DIGITAL SERVICES ACT 
 This enforcement initiative is taking place in parallel with the European Commission’s ongoing investigation into SHEIN under the Digital Services Act (DSA). SHEIN was officially designated as a Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) on 26 April 2024 and, under this designation, it is subject to heightened obligations, including the need to identify and mitigate systemic risks related to illegal content, user safety and consumer protection. 
 Current DSA inquiries into SHEIN are examining a variety of concerns, ranging from the presence of illegal goods and content on the platform to the opacity of its recommendation systems, which influence what products consumers see first. The company is also under scrutiny for the adequacy of its risk mitigation measures in areas such as mental health and public welfare. The coordinated enforcement campaign coincides with the Commission’s broader efforts to strengthen digital consumer rights, encapsulated in its Communication on a Comprehensive EU Toolbox for Safe and Sustainable E-commerce, released in February 2025, a policy which sets out a multi-stage approach to managing risks associated with global e-commerce imports and stresses the importance of coordinated action between consumer protection bodies and digital regulators. 
 Under the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation, the CPC Network comprises the national authorities of all 27 EU member states, as well as those of Norway and Iceland. Working collaboratively, they are empowered to investigate and enforce EU-wide consumer protection standards, including those established under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, Consumer Rights Directive, Price Indication Directive and the e-Commerce Directive. 
 It should be noted that this joint action is without prejudice to other ongoing or future legal proceedings. The Italian Competition Authority has already launched a national investigation into SHEIN’s commercial conduct. Similarly, the current action does not preclude parallel investigations under product safety legislation by EU market surveillance authorities or additional enforcement under the DSA.
