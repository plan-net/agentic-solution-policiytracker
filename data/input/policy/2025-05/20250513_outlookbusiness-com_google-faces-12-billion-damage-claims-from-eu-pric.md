Google Faces €12 Billion Damage Claims from EU Price-Comparison Sites Over Antitrust Breach Google Faces €12 Billion Damage Claims from EU Price-Comparison Sites Over Antitrust Breach Alphabet Inc’s Google faces damage claims of at least €12 bn from numerous price-comparison websites across the European Union, alleging that the search and advertising giant stole their consumers, Bloomberg reported. The civil proceedings stem from the European Commission’s 2017 decision to fine Google €2.4 bn for improperly leveraging its search dominance to favour its own retail business. This ruling triggered a series of “follow-on” lawsuits, which were delayed for years due to Google’s appeals. Last year a panel confirmed that Google violated antitrust regulations, removing the need for EU-based claimants to prove liability in court. Many of these cases are now progressing. Bloomberg News identified 12 pending civil cases across seven European countries. Although not all courts and parties disclosed the amounts involved, nine of the lawsuits collectively seek over €12 bn in damages. Follow our WhatsApp channel The challenges, which have become increasingly common in recent years, represent a new front in Google’s legal battles in Europe. If successful, these lawsuits could encourage more companies to pursue action against the internet giant, compounding the fines already imposed by EU regulators. Google maintains that none of the European civil lawsuits have merit. The corporation, valued at approximately $2 trn as of early May, declined to disclose the number of claims filed in connection with the antitrust ruling or the total amount involved. Google Pays $1Bn to Texas Recently Google agreed to pay Texas $1.375 bn to settle two lawsuits alleging that the company unlawfully tracked users’ personal location, incognito searches, voice data and facial-recognition data without consent. On Friday Texas attorney general Ken Paxton announced a preliminary agreement to resolve the privacy-violation cases against Google for $1.375 bn. Paxton described the settlement as a “historic win” for Texans’ data-privacy and security rights. In 2022 Texas sued Google, alleging that the company illegally collected and tracked users’ private data, including geolocation, incognito searches and biometric information. “In Texas, Big Tech is not above the law,” Paxton said. “For years, Google secretly tracked people’s movements, private searches and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.”
