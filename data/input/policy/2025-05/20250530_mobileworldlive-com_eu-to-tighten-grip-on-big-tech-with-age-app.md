The European Commission (EC) is set to launch an age verification app by mid-2025, stepping up efforts to enforce online safety rules targeting the protection of minors across digital platforms. 
 Positioned as an early version of the European Union’s (EU) digital identity wallet, an online ID verification tool expected to launch in 2026, the app will allow users to verify their age without sharing personal data directly with platforms. 
 The EU watchdog confirmed the app is designed to comply with its Digital Services Act, which mandates age checks for content such as pornography, gambling and alcohol-related services. EU tech policy lead Henna Virkkunen confirmed the development to Financial Times (FT), signalling the tool will launch by July. “The protection of minors is a very important priority for us, and we will take more action here,” she said.
 
 Operating under a joint venture dubbed T-Scy, Swedish software company Scytales and Deutsche Telekom-owned IT service provider T-Systems were awarded the contract to develop the app. A beta version and technical specifications have already been published, with testing underway across EU Member States. 
 As part of its regulatory efforts, the EC is also calling for children’s social media accounts to default to private settings, while aiming to curb addictive platform designs. Social media platforms Meta and TikTok are already under investigation over their algorithms and so-called addictive “rabbit-hole effects” that may pose risks to mental health. 
 “Many of the online platforms are using a design that is very addictive,” Virkkunen told the FT, adding that “minors are using [these apps] hours and hours”, negatively impacting their wellbeing. 
 The politician also noted that while some EU nations are calling for a minimum age to access social media, agreement remains difficult due to varying national contexts in the region. Still, she stressed that global cooperation is growing after the US also flagged concerns about online child safety. “This is now a high priority,” she added. 
 The latest development was revealed after the EC opened probes into four adult content platforms this week over concerns that their age verification systems fail to block underage access.
