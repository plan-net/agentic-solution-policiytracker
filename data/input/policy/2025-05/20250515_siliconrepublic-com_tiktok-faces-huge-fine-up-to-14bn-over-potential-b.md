‘We disagree with some of the Commission’s interpretations … a level playing field and consistent enforcement are essential,’ a TikTok spokesperson said. 
 In its preliminary view, the European Commission has found that TikTok breached the region’s Digital Services Act (DSA) by failing to provide necessary information about the advertisements on its platform. 
 The preliminary results stem from an investigation into TikTok which opened in 2024. The probe looked into the platform’s ad transparency, negative effects of its algorithmic systems, age assurance on the platform, privacy, safety, as well as access to data for researchers. 
 The investigation was triggered after the EU evaluated a risk assessment report submitted by TikTok following its designation as a ‘very large online platform’. 
 According to the Commission, its findings, published today (15 May), are based on an in-depth analysis of internal company documents, testing TikTok’s tools and interviews with experts in the field. 
 It found that TikTok does not provide the necessary information about the content of the ads on its platform, the users targeted by the ads or who paid for the advertisements. 
 Moreover, TikTok’s ad repository does not allow the public to search “comprehensively” for ads on the basis of this information, which the Commission says limits the usefulness of the tool. 
 The Chinese-owned social media giant now has the option to respond to the EU’s preliminary findings, while the Commission will also consult the European Board for Digital Services on TikTok’s practices. 
 If the EU’s preliminary views are confirmed, TikTok may face hefty fines which can range up to 6pc of its annual worldwide annual turnover, or nearly $1.4bn. 
 In addition, the social media platform may also be placed under supervision for a period until it complies with the required regulations. 
 A TikTok spokesperson told SiliconRepublic.com that the company is reviewing the Commission’s findings. 
 “While we support the goals of the regulation and continue to improve our ad transparency tools, we disagree with some of the Commission’s interpretations and note that guidance is being delivered via preliminary findings rather than clear, public guidelines,” the spokesperson said. “A level playing field and consistent enforcement are essential.” 
 TikTok, owned by Byte Dance, has come under fire several times over the recent years. 
 Late last year, the EU opened an investigation into the platform over its obligations to assess and mitigate systematic risks to ensure election integrity in the context of a controversial round of Romanian presidential elections in November. 
 While the app’s fate in the US is in the hands of president Donald Trump who granted its stay in the country a second extension.
