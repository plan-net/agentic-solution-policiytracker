 Setting global standards in digital governance

In May 2025, Singapore and the EU signed the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement (EUSDTA), marking a significant milestone in their longstanding economic partnership. This pioneering agreement is the first digital trade pact between the EU and an ASEAN country, reflecting a shared commitment to advancing digital trade, fostering innovation, and setting high standards for the global digital economy. The EUSDTA builds on the foundation laid by the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, expanding cooperation into the digital realm. It aims to facilitate seamless digital trade, enhance connectivity, and provide legal certainty for businesses and consumers operating across both regions. The agreement is particularly timely, given the rapid acceleration of digitalisation and the increasing importance of resilient, rules-based digital economies amid global uncertainties. 
 A central feature of the agreement is its commitment to facilitating trusted and secure cross-border data flows. This is critical for businesses in sectors such as finance, logistics, and e-commerce, which rely on the seamless movement of data to operate efficiently. The EUSDTA ensures that data can move freely between Singapore and the EU while maintaining high standards of privacy and data protection. Both parties have agreed to uphold their respective data protection regimes – the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) – ensuring that individuals’ privacy rights are respected and protected. 
 In addition to data flows, the EUSDTA addresses the need for interoperability in digital systems. It encourages the mutual recognition of electronic authentication and e-signatures, making it easier for businesses and consumers to engage in cross-border digital transactions. The agreement also supports the adoption of international standards for e-invoicing and electronic payments, which will help streamline business processes and reduce costs. 
 Furthermore, the agreement includes a permanent ban on customs duties for electronic transmissions, reinforcing the commitment to open and barrier-free digital markets. Both parties will also cooperate on pilot projects to digitalise trade administration, commercial documents, and e-invoicing, which will further enhance efficiency, transparency, and security in trade processes. The EUSDTA places a strong emphasis on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often face significant challenges in accessing international markets. By simplifying digital trade procedures and providing clear rules for digital transactions, the agreement opens up new opportunities for SMEs to expand their reach and participate in the global digital economy. 
 Another key aspect of the agreement is its focus on cooperation in emerging technologies. Singapore and the EU have committed to working together on issues such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital skills development. This collaborative approach is intended to foster innovation, ensure the ethical use of technology, and build a more inclusive digital economy that benefits all segments of society.
