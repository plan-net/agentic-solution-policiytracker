The European Union plans to introduce a flat €2 fee on small parcels sent directly to consumers, mainly targeting the flood of low-value packages arriving from China. 
 The proposal, unveiled by Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, would remove the current exemption from customs duties for items under €150. 
 The move comes as more than 4.6 billion parcels entered the EU last year, over 90 per cent of which originated in China. 
 Platforms such as Shein and Temu would be expected to pay the charge. 
 Sefcovic said the high volume of imports was placing a strain on customs operations and limiting the bloc’s ability to enforce product safety standards. The levy is intended to help offset costs and contribute to the EU budget. 
 Parcels sent to warehouses would face a lower €0.50 charge. The measure follows similar US action, where tariffs on small packages were raised, fuelling concern about a shift in Chinese e-commerce traffic to Europe.
