7Learnings, a Berlin-based provider of AI-powered retail optimisation technology, today announced the successful close of its Series B funding round, securing over €10 million in new investment. 
 The funding round was led by Acton Capital. The existing investor High-Tech Gründerfonds also participated in the round, renewing their commitment. The funding will accelerate 7Learnings’ international expansion, with a strategic focus on entering the North American market. 
 “ We’ve built a profitable business by delivering measurable results for our customers,” said Felix Hoffmann, CEO and Co-founder of 7Learnings. “ Amidst trade uncertainties, persistent inflation, and global supply chain challenges, better decision intelligence has become business-critical for brands and e-commerce merchants. This investment allows us to bring our technology to even more retailers worldwide, with North America as our next major focus.” 
 Founded in 2019 by Felix Hoffmann, Eiko van Hettinga, and Martin Nowak, 7Learnings provides an AI-powered retail optimisation platform for B2C companies, innovating the overarching optimisation of pricing, performance marketing, and product ordering. 
 With 7Learnings’ machine learning algorithm, retailers and brands can reportedly predict the impact of pricing decisions, determine the optimal price for all products, and reduce manual labor by up to 80%. 
 Its clients include international companies such as Westwing, Bonprix, Tom Tailor, Tamaris, and DK Company. 
 “ Pricing is one of the most powerful levers for driving profitability in e-commerce. What impressed us about 7Learnings is their state-of-the-art proprietary AI technology, which consistently outperforms the competition. They’ve already established themselves as the market leader in Germany, and we’re excited to support their international expansion,” says Sebastian Wossagk, managing partner at Acton Capital. 
 7Learnings has reached profitability ahead of its Series B round, and with this new investment earmarked entirely for growth, the company looks to capitalise on its momentum and extend its global footprint. 
 “ With the continued pressure from inflation and shifting consumer behavior, as well as the renewed impact of U.S. tariffs on our sourcing and pricing strategy, 7Learnings has been instrumental in helping us navigate these challenges. Its AI-powered pricing and retail optimization tools allow us to adapt quickly, make smarter pricing decisions, and protect our margins without compromising on brand integrity or customer experience,” adds Timo Bethlehem, Managing Director at meinemarkenmode.de. The fashion retailer has been working with 7Learnings for 5 years, reportedly achieving a 13% revenue increase by leveraging predictive pricing. 
 With its ability to synchronise pricing, marketing, and ordering decisions through machine learning, 7Learnings aims to empower retailers to make smarter, faster, and more profitable decisions at scale. 
 “At a time when AI has seemingly infused any technology-driven business, it is more important than ever to look at its ROI. The AI applications provided by 7Learnings deliver a clear and tangible effect on their customers’ bottom line. We have been impressed with the leadership’s vision and drive, and are happy to double down on our investment,” adds Martin Möllmann, Principal at HTGF.
