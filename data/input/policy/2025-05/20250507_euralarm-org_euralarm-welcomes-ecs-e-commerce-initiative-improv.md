This article presents Euralarm's postiion towards the e-commerce initiative of the European Commission. 
 The rapid growth of e-commerce has transformed global markets and is creating new opportunities. The downside is that ecommerce also introduces significant challenges in consumer safety, market fairness, and regulatory compliance. The European Commission provides a framework for addressing these challenges through a technical approach that ensures a level playing field for all market operators. These actions are part of the Communication on E-Commerce, ‘A Comprehensive EU Toolbox for Safe and Sustainable E-commerce’, which the Commission has proposed recently. Euralarm welcomes this direction, as it aligns with our mission to safeguard European consumers, businesses, and public safety from the risks associated with non-compliant imports and unfair market practices. 
 Championing fair market practices 
 Euralarm actively supports EU regulations that foster fair competition and protect consumers. With the rise of low-cost, non-compliant imports, enforcing strict regulations is essential to uphold the high safety and security standards that Euralarm promotes. As representatives of the European fire safety and security industry, we stress the need for fair market conditions that allow compliant businesses to succeed. 
 Euralarm members are dedicated to safeguarding European consumers and their data. As the EU prioritizes security and digital transformation, we align our efforts to strengthen trust in the European market. The fire safety and security industries play a vital role in this evolution, ensuring that innovation advances without compromising safety or compliance. 
 Tackling risks from non-compliant imports 
 The rise of non-compliant products entering the European market through online platforms presents a significant challenge in today’s e-commerce landscape. Many of these products fail to meet essential safety, cybersecurity, and quality standards, putting both citizens and businesses at risk. Euralarm strongly supports the European Commission’s initiatives to enhance market surveillance and prevent unsafe products from reaching consumers. Strengthening enforcement mechanisms will be key to mitigating these risks while preserving the integrity of the European market. Euralarm members who uphold the highest standards of conformity and regulatory compliance welcome this risk focused approach. 
 Enhancing EU regulations and market surveillance 
 To safeguard European businesses and consumers, Euralarm advocates for the robust enforcement of key EU regulations, including the Digital Services Act (DSA), Digital Markets Act (DMA), Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and the General Product Safety Regulation. Reinforcing market surveillance in line with the E-commerce Communication will help ensure that all products—whether sold online or offline—comply with EU standards. Implementing these safeguards is essential to maintaining a secure and competitive European market. 
 Promoting European innovation and investments 
 Euralarm supports regulatory measures that promote the investments and innovations of European companies. A well-regulated e-commerce sector ensures that businesses operating within the EU framework are not undermined by unfair competition from non-compliant imports. Strengthening compliance and surveillance will help maintain trust in European safety and security solutions while fostering innovation and economic growth. 
 A unified call for action 
 Euralarm urges policymakers and stakeholders to prioritize enforcement and compliance in the e-commerce sector. A harmonized and stringent approach will not only protect consumers but also ensure the competitiveness of European businesses. By working together, we can uphold high safety standards and promote a secure digital marketplace for all. 
 As leading advocate for fire safety and security, Euralarm remains committed to supporting policies that reinforce the integrity of the European market. We look forward to continued collaboration with EU institutions, industry partners, and regulatory bodies to drive meaningful progress in this critical area.
