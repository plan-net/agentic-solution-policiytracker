# Crypto.com Gains EU Approval to Offer Crypto Financial Derivatives

Crypto.com has picked up the regulatory green light it needed to deepen its footprint in Europe’s financial markets. 
 The exchange, known for its mobile-first approach and growing payment tools, confirmed that it secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license. That approval allows it to offer regulated crypto derivatives throughout the European Economic Area (EEA). 
 Europe’s Crypto Usage Signals a Market Ready for More Than Speculation 
 This is the type of license that does more than tick a compliance box. It gives Crypto.com a direct line into a region where digital assets are already being used for real purchases. Retailers, real estate offices, and a growing number of online gambling sites are already transacting in crypto. 
 According to gambling analyst Djordje Todorovic, some of those platforms use blockchain technology to allow players to withdraw winnings in under an hour, offer bonus-heavy promos, and provide access to libraries with thousands of titles. Crypto.com’s decision to double down on Europe through a derivatives strategy matches the pace of that broader shift in how digital assets are being used, not just traded. 
 Strategic Move Backed by a Clear Regulatory Route 
 The license was made possible through its purchase of A.N. Allnew Investments, a Cyprus-based firm with an existing MiFID framework. The deal had been under review by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) and has now cleared, paving the way for Crypto.com to formally enter the derivatives market across all 30 EEA countries under a passporting arrangement. 
 That’s not a small win. Most exchanges still sit in legal gray zones across multiple jurisdictions. What this license provides is regulatory clarity and the opportunity to offer more complex financial products without relying on loopholes or operating offshore. For a company trying to be seen as more than a retail exchange, it pushes the brand closer to financial institutions that are already working under MiFID standards. 
 Following the Trend 
 In terms of strategy, this mirrors a playbook other exchanges are now following. Kraken rolled out its own derivatives desk in Europe through a Cyprus entity called Payward Europe Digital Solutions. That followed its acquisition of futures platform NinjaTrader and coincided with a revenue increase of nearly 20% in the first quarter. Coinbase isn’t staying quiet either. The US-based firm is moving forward with the acquisition of Deribit, one of the biggest crypto derivatives platforms globally. Gemini and even DeFi-native platforms like Synthetix are now in the same race. 
 What links all these moves together is the push toward a segment of crypto trading that already outpaces the spot market. According to TokenInsight, over 70% of crypto volume last year came from derivatives. These contracts give traders tools to hedge positions, manage risk, or speculate in more nuanced ways. For platforms, they also offer more predictable revenue from spreads and fees, something that’s harder to rely on in a spot-only model. 
 Strengthening Its Global Footprint with Key Acquisitions 
 Crypto.com’s effort in this space hasn’t been a one-off. The company has also previously acquired Fintek Securities, Charterprime, Orion Principals, and Watchdog Capital, a US-based broker-dealer registered with the SEC. Each acquisition serves a particular regulatory purpose, piecing together a multi-jurisdictional architecture that lets it offer products legally across both sides of the Atlantic. 
 The MiFID license carries weight in more ways than one. Beyond simply offering regulated derivatives, it helps Crypto.com build out a platform that institutions can use. Larger players, including funds, asset managers, and banks, need compliant channels to access crypto markets. Spot purchases are often constrained by internal risk limits. Derivatives, when regulated, fit more easily into existing risk models. The license removes a friction point for those looking to allocate capital without running afoul of internal compliance policies. 
 Europe’s Regulatory Maturity Offers a Competitive Edge 
 There’s another layer too. Europe has been rolling out the MiCA framework with far more cohesion than the US has managed. That’s creating a regulatory environment where firms like Crypto.com can plan beyond quarter-to-quarter headlines. In contrast, American firms are still navigating lawsuits, mixed signals from the SEC and CFTC, and a lack of formal legislation. Crypto.com, like others in its tier, is reading the room. Europe is being treated as the safest zone for long-term expansion, and MiFID is the passport that gets them in. 
 That passport also opens up a host of new products. With a MiFID license, Crypto.com can offer futures, options, and structured contracts, all under oversight and subject to capital requirements and customer protections. It means those who trade on the platform know the terms aren’t arbitrary. They’re built into a system that regulators monitor, audit, and enforce. That makes a difference, especially in a sector still carrying the scars of the FTX collapse and other high-profile failures. 
 Institutional Appetite Aligns With Regulated Infrastructure 
 There’s no ignoring the momentum. This is not a fringe corner of crypto anymore. When mainstream platforms start hiring compliance officers faster than they launch tokens, it’s clear the market is shifting toward durability rather than hype cycles. Crypto.com’s licensing effort reflects that broader shift, moving from a pure tech-first startup into a financial services firm that offers crypto instruments within existing legal systems. 
 What stands out in Crypto.com’s approach is the absence of shortcuts. Unlike firms that operate through reverse mergers, loosely regulated shell entities, or decentralized governance tokens meant to shield liability, Crypto.com is pursuing state-by-state approval. That includes formal oversight in Singapore, a payments license in the UK, and a virtual asset license from Dubai’s VARA. This latest European step fits that same pattern. 
 Global Market Share Will Come Down to Regulatory Readiness 
 At the same time, the competition is intensifying. Every exchange now understands that revenue from spot trades won’t keep scaling. Binance, once dominant in every vertical, is recalibrating in the face of mounting legal pressure. Smaller exchanges, meanwhile, are consolidating to survive. The derivatives market is where margins exist, and it’s where the next phase of user acquisition will be fought. 
 For now, Crypto.com’s entry into this space sets up the possibility of more institutional volume flowing through a regulated gateway. It also sets a higher bar for what a licensed crypto platform can offer in terms of sophistication. Retail users may still gravitate toward the flashier products, but institutions are looking for frameworks that match the rules they already follow. 
 Derivatives as a Path to Market Maturity 
 That’s exactly what the MiFID license provides: a bridge between digital finance and traditional capital markets, one that removes ambiguity from how products are issued, sold, and taxed. For traders, that means more tools. For investors, it means more trust. For regulators, it means a blueprint that others can follow. 
 This isn’t just about expanding product menus or adding new revenue streams. It’s about who will be standing when the next wave of regulation finishes rolling through global markets. Exchanges that are proactively licensed will have a head start. Those who delay or overextend could face walls they can’t scale later. 
 Crypto.com has made its move now, not after the fact. In a space that punishes hesitation as much as it does missteps, timing might be the real advantage.
