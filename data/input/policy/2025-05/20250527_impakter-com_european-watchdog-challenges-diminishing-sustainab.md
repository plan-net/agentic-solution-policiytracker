 Ombudswoman questions the European Commission’s lack of transparency 
 In 1995, an independent watchdog, known as the European Ombudsman, was established to investigate malpractice by the European Union. The current Ombudswoman, Teresa Anjinho, launched an inquiry on Friday into the European Commission’s handling of sustainability laws, following recent complaints from campaigners. These campaigners claim that the Commission did not consult the general public before pulling back some of its sustainability regulations. The Commission has weakened its policies by removing sustainability reporting requirements for smaller companies and reducing the burden for larger companies concerning their supply chains. Anjinho has reached out to the Commission, questioning why the public was left in the dark and what companies were included in the decision-making process.  As the rules are constantly changing, ESG solutions are the first step in complying with the most up-to-date EU regulations.

 In the fashion industry, workers are often exploited. Italy, home to high-end brands such as Valentino and Armani, accounts for more than half of the world’s luxury fashion production. On Monday, government officials and leaders in the fashion industry signed an agreement to combat exploitation in the workplace and ensure a better working environment. Although the plan is not legally binding, it gives brands the push they need for fairer business practices and greater transparency. Through this plan, companies will be required to input data regarding their supply chain, tax compliance, and labour law compliance. Transparency is becoming increasingly important as the world shifts. Companies can ensure compliance and transparency by using ESG tools.

 Congestion in European ports increases as demand surges

 The impending trade wars have increased shipping demand as industries worldwide strive to beat the looming tariffs. This increase in shipping has led to severe congestion at ports throughout Europe. Waiting times for berths have increased dramatically in some cities, from 37% in Antwerp, Belgium, to 77% in Bremerhaven, Germany. In addition to higher demand, water levels in the Rhine River have decreased, preventing ships from entering, and labor shortages are affecting port operations. Conditions are slowly improving, but experts believe it will take another 6 to 8 weeks to get back on track. The shipping industry could face further setbacks with the 50% tariffs Trump is threatening to place on the EU. In a recent call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, he agreed to delay these tariffs until July 9. With the tariff roller coaster causing much uncertainty across markets, many companies have found themselves at a standstill, watching to see how this storm develops.

 The fast fashion brand SHEIN has come under scrutiny from the European Union’s Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network. After their investigation, the European Commission released a statement on Sunday, claiming that the online clothing giant has been breaking numerous EU policies by offering fake discounts and misleading labels and claims. Among these deceptive claims are false sustainability declarations and incorrect information concerning returns and refunds. SHEIN has one month to respond to the allegations made by the CPC Network. If the company fails to make the necessary changes and comply with EU consumer laws, it may face fines and other enforcement measures. ESG solutions are a wonderful tool for ensuring a company complies with EU consumer laws and regulations.
