# The European Board for Digital Services launches a coordinated action to reinforce the protection of minors as regards pornographic platforms

The European Board for Digital Services shares the European Commission’s concerns about certain platforms which make pornographic content unlawfully accessible to minors across the European Union against Union or national legislation. The Board welcomes the European Commission’s action of 27 May 2025 against such platforms designated as  Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs), namely an in-depth investigation regarding possible infringements of the Digital Services Act’s (DSA) provisions on the protection of minors. 
 The Board further notes that there are many online pornographic platforms which are not designated as VLOPs and are thus subject to national enforcement. The Board further considers that it is important to take a consistent approach on the enforcement of the platforms’ obligation to ensure a high level of privacy, safety and security of minors online, which includes ensuring that minors are not unlawfully offered access to pornography online, regardless of the reach of the service in question. Digital Services Coordinators (DSCs), where necessary in cooperation with other national competent authorities, will continue taking steps alongside the European Commission’s actions. 
 To support the consistent and efficient application of the DSA, and complementing the Commission’s enforcement, the Board is tasking its Working Group 6 (Protection of minors) to facilitate coordination of the actions taken at national level. In this context, DSCs, and, where relevant, other national competent authorities, will exchange, for instance, on enforcement approaches, methodologies and best practices, particularly in identifying pornographic platforms and evaluating existing age verification measures on those platforms. These exchanges and evaluations will be guided by the finalised guidelines for Article 28 of the DSA, which are currently in public consultation, and in light of the results and findings of the Commission’s ongoing investigations. 
 When there are sufficient indications of a possible breach of the DSA, the DSCs, within the scope of their competence and where necessary in cooperation with national competent authorities, will take investigative and, where appropriate, enforcement action, potentially leading to sanctions, including fines. 
 Protection of minors has always been a core value and objective of the European Union. This coordinated approach ensures a consistent outcome and represents a significant step towards the common goal of ensuring a safe online environment for minors.
