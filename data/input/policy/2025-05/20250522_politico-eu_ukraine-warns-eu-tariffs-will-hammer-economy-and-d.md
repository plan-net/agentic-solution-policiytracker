BRUSSELS — As the EU prepares to reimpose steep tariffs on Ukrainian farm goods next month, a top Ukrainian lawmaker has issued a blunt warning: The move risks not just economic damage to a war-battered ally, but a loss of trust in Europe itself. 
 Dmytro Natalukha, chair of the Ukrainian parliament’s Economic Affairs Committee, traveled to Brussels this week with 11 fellow lawmakers to plead for a swift, long-term trade solution before the EU’s wartime tariff waivers, known as Autonomous Trade Measures, expire on June 5. 
 “This is the first time in our history a parliamentary committee has held a session outside the country,” Natalukha told POLITICO. “The symbolism matters. We are here because trade with the EU is critically important to Ukraine.” 
 
 The economic stakes are clear.  
 A return to prewar trade conditions would cut Ukraine’s export revenues by up to €3.5 billion annually, slashing its projected economic growth for 2025 from 2.7 percent to 0.9 percent, according to Kyiv’s estimates. The European Commission’s proposed “transitional” fix — restoring old quotas on only some sensitive goods such as maize, poultry and sugar — may blunt the economic blow, but only slightly. 
 The political cost, Natalukha argued, could be even higher. 
 “If there’s no bridging solution or meaningful alternative, it’s not just a broken promise,” he said in an interview. “It’s a signal that when things get difficult, the EU looks inward, not outward. That will be used by Russian propaganda, and it will hit morale in Ukraine.” 
 Standing on one leg 
 Ukraine is especially vulnerable, Natalukha said, because its other major export sector — metallurgy — depends on raw materials from the Pokrovsk basin in the Donetsk region, where fighting is fierce and ongoing. 
 “If we lose Pokrovsk, metallurgy is gone and agriculture is the only leg we’re standing on,” he said. “Undermining that would be catastrophic.”

 The Commission has repeatedly confirmed it won’t extend the ATMs beyond June 5, citing legal limitations and the need to update a pre-existing trade accord, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). But Ukrainian officials say talks with the EU side have barely started, and accuse Brussels of dragging its feet. 
 Natalukha said the Commission’s trade team didn’t respond to a request for a meeting. “We don’t just see no alternative being discussed,” he said. “We don’t even see the process.” 
 The transition was widely backed by EU member countries in a committee vote on Thursday. Only Sweden, Denmark, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania abstained, according to diplomats and officials with direct knowledge of the matter. 
 This approach creates uncertainty, Natalukha warned, particularly if quotas are exhausted within weeks, as they often were before the war. 
 “Predictability is the key,” he said. “If we get a quota that’s gone in a month, we’re back to square one.” 
 Responding, a Commission spokesperson said the transitional measures were designed to avoid a “cliff-edge” scenario resulting from the expiry of the wartime waivers. 
 
 “The Commission is currently working on the review of the [DCFTA], with a view to offering longer-term predictability and stability to EU and Ukrainian operators, including in the perspective of the accession of Ukraine to the EU,” the spokesperson added. 
 Political games 
 Natalukha was particularly blunt about the political roots of the rollback, saying Ukraine had become a “convenient tool” in domestic EU debates, especially in countries like Poland and France, where farmers’ protests have rattled governments. 
 “Ukraine has been weaponized like migration or LGBT rights,” he said. “You throw it into a campaign to divide voters.” 
 The lawmaker, from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party, dismissed claims that Ukraine was flooding the EU with cheap, low-quality products or flouting standards. At the same time, he said, Ukrainian producers are struggling to compete with EU imports, particularly from Poland, but Kyiv has avoided retaliation. 
 “Our cheese and dairy producers are having a hard time with Polish imports,” he said. “But we don’t block anything. We follow the rules.” 
 He also pushed back against claims that Ukraine’s trade system is dominated by shadowy agribusiness oligarchs. “Look at the numbers,” he said. “Agriculture brings real money to the state budget. This isn’t about a few men profiting — it’s how the country stays afloat.”

 Asked whether these trade tensions were eroding Ukrainians’ faith in the EU, Natalukha didn’t hesitate: “Yes, it hurts. Ukrainians are emotionally exhausted. And when they see this kind of treatment, it feeds the narrative that Europe will never really welcome them.” 
 He warned that a prolonged impasse could give rise to Euroskeptic parties in Ukraine before it even joins the EU. 
 Still, Natalukha struck a note of pragmatism: “We’re not asking for anything exceptional,” he said. “We just want fair, predictable trade — and for the promises made to be kept.” 
 Responding further, the Commission said it was in close contact with Ukraine to review the bilateral trade agreement, but declined to give further details. 
 “The EU aims to keep the length of this transition as short as possible. We will work swiftly and constructively toward an agreement. Our aim is to make meaningful progress and reach a balanced, workable outcome as soon as possible,” the spokesperson said.
