Amazon to install over 70 automated packaging machines in Europe by year-end, scaling further through 2027. 
 Made-to-fit packaging reduces delivery emissions by optimizing material use and transport efficiency. 
 New technologies—including on-demand paper bags and smaller labels—slash waste and packaging volume. 
 
 Amazon is scaling up its packaging automation across Europe in a bid to slash waste and reduce the environmental footprint of its deliveries. 
 The e-commerce giant will deploy hundreds of new machines at its European fulfilment centers, starting with over 70 installations in Germany, the UK, France, Italy, and Spain by the end of 2025. The initiative is set to expand further by 2027. 
 Why it matters: 
 Tailor-made packaging is central to Amazon’s drive toward sustainability. Using advanced automation and machine learning, these new systems craft custom-sized cardboard boxes and paper bags in real time—eliminating excess material and optimizing logistics. 
 
 “ In order to reduce waste, we need to reduce packaging,” said Pat Lindner, VP Mechatronics and Sustainable Packaging at Amazon. “We use machine learning and automation to create packaging that’s made to fit, reducing excess materials while making sure the product remains protected.”

 Inside the automation 
 
 Custom Cardboard Boxes: Machines measure each item with precision sensors and produce right-sized boxes on the spot. Labels are applied directly, streamlining the process for faster, more efficient dispatch. These machines will primarily be used for heavier or fragile items requiring more protection than envelopes can offer. 
 On-Demand Paper Bags: Retrofitted from plastic-bag machines, this innovation creates protective, recyclable paper bags tailored to item size—no padding required. Already tested in Germany and the UK, the system will now roll out to five major European markets. These bags are up to 90% lighter than comparable cardboard boxes and save an average of 26 grams of packaging per shipment. 
 Smaller, Smarter Labels: The Universal Robotic Labeller applies compact labels—even on irregularly shaped items—cutting label size by up to 75%. In some cases, the system allows Amazon to eliminate outer packaging entirely by placing labels directly on the product’s own box.

 “ This investment is a significant step forward in reducing the environmental impact of deliveries for our European customers,” said Lindner. 
 
 Bigger picture: Toward packaging-free delivery 
 Half of Amazon’s European shipments already arrive in reduced or no packaging. Since 2019, more than one billion items have shipped without additional packaging through Amazon’s “Ships in Product Packaging” program. 
 The automation push represents the next leap in that evolution—helping Amazon move faster, greener, and leaner in how it gets products to millions of customers.
