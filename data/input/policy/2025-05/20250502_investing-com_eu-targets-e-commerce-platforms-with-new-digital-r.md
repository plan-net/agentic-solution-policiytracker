Investing.com -- The European Commission is focusing on e-commerce platforms such as Shein with its new digital regulations, as concerns grow over potentially unsafe or unlawful cheap products entering the European Union (EU).

On Wednesday, the commission announced plans to introduce a customs reform. This reform would require platforms to provide data on the products they sell to the EU, enabling officials to have increased oversight of packages entering the region.

In addition to this, the EU's executive arm also proposed more coordinated surveillance in collaboration with customs authorities in EU countries.

The aim of this measure is to assist in the removal of non-compliant products from the market.

These actions are part of the commission's effort to ensure that all products sold within the EU meet the region's safety and legal standards.
