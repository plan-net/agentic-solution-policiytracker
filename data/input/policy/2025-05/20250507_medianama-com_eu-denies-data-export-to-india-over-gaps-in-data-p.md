# EU Denies Data Export to India Over Gaps in Data Protection Law Equivalent to GDPR Standards

In February 2024, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) refused to let the European Investment Bank (EIB) transfer contact data to India. The EU’s independent data protection agency didn’t find enough “evidence and proof” that India could protect personal data the way the GDPR requires. 
 “We denied this authorisation because there was not enough evidence and proof that these countries could protect individuals’ personal data in the same way as in the EU,” the EDPS noted in its 2024 annual report. 
 The data in question was basic—just contact information. But the EDPS’s decision wasn’t just about the data type. It reflected something deeper: the EU doesn’t trust India’s data privacy law, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), to hold up when it comes to cross-border rights and enforcement. 
 DPDPA gives users rights but not the tools to enforce them 
 India passed the DPDPA in August 2023 after years of deliberation. The law introduced consent requirements and gave users the right to access and erase their data. But when it comes to international transfers, the law doesn’t match the EU’s standards. 
 Take adequacy, for example. Before companies can freely send personal data to another country under the GDPR, the European Commission has to first review and approve that country’s privacy laws. India doesn’t have any such system. It allows companies to send personal data abroad unless the Indian government says otherwise, meaning there’s no upfront check for whether the receiving country protects user rights. 
 Another issue lies in enforcement. The DPDPA sets up a Data Protection Board, but the central government appoints and manages it. Under Article 52 of the GDPR, EU regulators work independently. No government or outside body can tell them what to do, which means they can look into public offices or private companies without anyone getting in the way. 
 India’s draft data protection rules shift responsibility to users 
 In early 2025, the Indian government released draft rules to implement the DPDPA. These rules told users they could access or delete their data, but only if they shared specific identifiers like a customer ID, license numbers, or booking references. Say someone used a ride-hailing app and wanted their data erased. They’d have to find the right booking ID, send a request to the company, and then wait for a reply from the very platform that collected their data in the first place. 
 If the request is ignored, users can’t approach the Data Protection Board right away. They have to first go through the company’s internal complaint process. 
 The same logic applies to data retention. The draft rules allow companies like e-commerce platforms and social media apps to store personal data for up to three years after a user stops engaging. Companies must send a 48-hour notice before deleting the data. For example, some platforms have sent out such notices without providing a way to view or download purchase histories, leaving users stuck. 
 In practice, users have to guard their own data and follow up on whether companies delete or misuse it because the system doesn’t step in unless they complain first. 
 That’s the gap. In India, companies make users do the legwork: dig up booking IDs, file complaints, and wait for replies before any regulator steps in. In the EU, regulators do not wait. They investigate problems on their own, act early, and hold companies accountable when they break the rules. Advertisements 
 EU tightening its own data protection law 
 While India is still finalising how to implement its data law, the EU is getting ready to raise the bar. Its 2025 GDPR reform package includes stricter rules around AI profiling, better transparency for data exports, and tougher documentation requirements. 
 The EU isn’t just writing rules; it’s enforcing them. The regulators fined Meta €1.3 billion in 2023 for sending user data to the US under outdated contracts. They also fined TikTok €345 million after its default settings left teen profiles public and easy to access. These cases didn’t just lead to fines; they included investigations, documentation, and formal orders based on independent audits. 
 That’s the kind of enforcement infrastructure the EU expects from its data partners. 
 Why this matters 
 The EDPS’s rejection makes one thing clear: India’s current data privacy law doesn’t offer the kind of system the EU trusts. And until that changes, India will remain outside the list of countries that European institutions can freely share data with. 
 This isn’t just a setback for regulators; it’s a roadblock for Indian companies hoping to handle EU user data or win contracts with European partners. Without a way to guarantee enforcement, demonstrate independence, or offer users a real pathway to hold data handlers accountable, India won’t meet the GDPR’s standard of “essential equivalence.”
