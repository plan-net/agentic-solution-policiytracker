# New EU Regulations Aim to Revolutionize Building Efficiency | Interreg Europe

*By By Project MonitorEE*

Starting in January 2030, all residential buildings in the EU will need to meet at least an E energy efficiency rating, and by January 2033, this will rise to a D rating or better. These new rules, part of the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), are stepping stones towards...

Starting in January 2030, all residential buildings in the EU will need to meet at least an E energy efficiency rating, and by January 2033, this will rise to a D rating or better. These new rules, part of the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), are stepping stones towards the ambitious goal of achieving zero-emission buildings across the EU by 2050. 
 The updated Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU/2024/1275), which came into effect on May 28, 2024, is designed to accelerate the renovation of the EU’s least efficient buildings. It also addresses air quality, supports the digitalization of energy systems, and promotes sustainable mobility infrastructure. Recognizing the diversity in building conditions across the EU, the directive allows countries to tailor their renovation strategies to fit local contexts. 
 In Spain, where over 80% of buildings are currently rated E, F, or G—indicating poor energy efficiency—this new directive poses a considerable challenge. Some regions, like the Basque Country and the Canary Islands, face even higher percentages of inefficient buildings due to their older building stock, much of which dates back to before 1980 when energy efficiency regulations were not in place. 
 Looking further ahead, the MEPS require that by 2040, all buildings must achieve an A or B energy efficiency rating, aligning with the broader goal of zero-emission buildings by 2050. For non-residential buildings, the directive outlines a phased approach: by January 2030, the 15% of the worst-performing buildings must be renovated, with the next 10% following by January 2034. This is part of a broader target to reduce the average energy performance of the national residential building stock by 16% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels, and by 20-22% by 2035. 
 The directive also introduces several key measures: new buildings must be zero-emission, and the carbon footprint of new constructions will be calculated over their entire lifecycle. Long-term renovation strategies, now called national Building Renovation Plans, must be developed, and Energy Performance Certificates will be enhanced for greater reliability and digitalization. Building renovation passports will guide property owners through staged and deep energy renovations. 
 Other notable initiatives include increasing the use of solar technologies on new and certain existing buildings where feasible, ensuring new buildings are ready for solar installations. The directive also mandates a gradual phase-out of fossil fuel boilers, beginning with the end of subsidies for these systems from January 2025. One-stop-shops for energy renovations will be set up to assist homeowners and businesses, and there will be more electric vehicle charging points and bike parking facilities in buildings. 
 Finally, the directive emphasizes improved data collection and sharing to boost knowledge of the building stock and energy consumption patterns. 
 In essence, the revised EPBD sets a comprehensive agenda to transform the EU's building sector into a model of energy efficiency and sustainability by 2050.
