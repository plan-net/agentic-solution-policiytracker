July 15, 2024

ENHANCED CYBERSECURITY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES

SUMMARY

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finalized enhanced cybersecurity disclosure requirements under Items 106 and 1.05 of Form 8-K and new Item 106 of Regulation S-K. These rules require public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents and provide annual disclosures about cybersecurity risk management and governance.

INCIDENT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS (FORM 8-K)

Triggering Events:
A cybersecurity incident is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision.

Form 8-K Filing Timeline:
- File within FOUR business days of determining materiality
- Clock starts when company concludes incident is material
- No extension available except for national security concerns

Required Disclosures in Item 1.05:
1. Nature, scope, and timing of the incident
2. Material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the company
3. Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used
4. Remediation efforts undertaken or planned
5. Whether third parties (including law enforcement) have been notified

Information NOT Required if Unreasonably Harmful:
Companies may omit specific technical information about vulnerabilities or security measures if disclosure would be unreasonably harmful to national security or public safety.

ANNUAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS (FORM 10-K)

New Item 106 of Regulation S-K requires annual disclosure of:

Risk Management and Strategy:
- Processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material cybersecurity risks
- Whether risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into overall risk management
- Use of third-party service providers for cybersecurity risk assessment
- Description of material cybersecurity risks and their potential impact

Governance:
- Board oversight of cybersecurity risks
- Management's role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks
- Relevant cybersecurity expertise of board members and management
- Reporting processes between management and board

BOARD CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE

Disclosure Requirements:
Companies must describe any cybersecurity expertise of board members, including:
- Prior work experience in cybersecurity
- Relevant degrees or certifications
- Other relevant experience (such as oversight of cybersecurity at other companies)

No Safe Harbor:
Disclosure of cybersecurity expertise does not create a fiduciary duty regarding cybersecurity
No requirement to have cybersecurity experts on the board

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

Factors to Consider:
1. Nature and scope of affected systems and data
2. Impact on company operations and reputation
3. Financial impact including costs of remediation
4. Potential for ongoing harm or unauthorized access
5. Legal and regulatory obligations
6. Impact on business relationships and competitive position

Examples of Potentially Material Incidents:
- Ransomware affecting critical business operations
- Theft of trade secrets or intellectual property
- Compromise of customer financial or personal data
- Disruption of manufacturing or supply chain systems
- Unauthorized access to financial reporting systems

SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS

Forward-Looking Statements:
Disclosures about cybersecurity risk management processes and potential impacts qualify for safe harbor protection under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act

Good Faith Compliance:
No liability for disclosure decisions made in good faith based on reasonable assessment of materiality at time of determination

ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES

SEC Focus Areas:
1. Timely filing of Form 8-K for material incidents
2. Adequacy of risk factor disclosures
3. Board oversight and expertise disclosures
4. Controls and procedures around cybersecurity disclosure

Recent Enforcement Actions:
- Company A: $10M penalty for delayed incident disclosure
- Company B: $5M penalty for inadequate risk factor updates
- Company C: Cease and desist order for insufficient board oversight disclosure

INTERACTION WITH OTHER REGULATIONS

State Data Breach Laws:
SEC disclosure requirements are separate from and in addition to state data breach notification laws
Timing differences may require different disclosure strategies

Industry-Specific Requirements:
- Financial services: Coordination with banking regulators
- Healthcare: HIPAA breach notification requirements
- Critical infrastructure: CISA incident reporting

International Considerations:
- EU GDPR breach notifications
- UK ICO reporting requirements
- Cross-border incident coordination

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

Form 8-K Best Practices:
1. Establish incident response team including legal and disclosure experts
2. Create materiality assessment templates and decision trees
3. Prepare draft disclosure language for common incident types
4. Establish clear escalation and approval processes
5. Coordinate with cyber insurance providers and external counsel

Annual Disclosure Preparation:
1. Conduct annual assessment of cybersecurity risk management processes
2. Document board and management cybersecurity oversight activities
3. Review and update cybersecurity risk factors
4. Assess cybersecurity expertise of directors and officers
5. Consider engagement of external cybersecurity experts for validation

COMMON DISCLOSURE CHALLENGES

Timing Issues:
- Distinguishing between incident detection and materiality determination
- Managing disclosure during ongoing investigations
- Coordinating with law enforcement requests for delays

Technical Complexity:
- Translating technical details into investor-relevant information
- Balancing transparency with security considerations
- Avoiding disclosure of ongoing vulnerabilities

Board and Management Roles:
- Defining appropriate level of board cybersecurity oversight

- Characterizing cybersecurity expertise appropriately

COMPLIANCE DEADLINES

Immediate (Effective December 15, 2023):
