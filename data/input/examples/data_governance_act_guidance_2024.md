**Document Type**: Regulatory Guidance  
**Date**: June 5, 2024  
**Source**: European Data Protection Board (EDPB)  
**Reference**: DGA-GUIDE-2024/002  
**Jurisdiction**: European Union  

## Introduction

The Data Governance Act (DGA) establishes a framework for European data governance to foster data availability for use while preserving privacy and other fundamental rights. This guidance specifically addresses the obligations for data intermediation services and requirements for data altruism organizations.

## Scope and Definitions

### Data Intermediation Services
Services that aim to establish commercial relationships for the purposes of data sharing between an undetermined number of data subjects and data holders on the one hand and data users on the other hand.

**Covered Services Include:**
- Data marketplaces and exchanges
- Data pooling services for IoT data
- Personal data management platforms
- Consent management platforms with data sharing features
- Federated learning service providers

**Excluded Services:**
- Data processing services (under data controller/processor arrangements)
- Cloud infrastructure services
- Internal data sharing within corporate groups
- Direct bilateral data sharing agreements

### Data Altruism Organizations
Organizations whose objective is to collect and process data made available for altruistic purposes by data subjects or legal persons based on consent or permission.

## Notification Requirements

### Data Intermediation Service Providers

**Notification Deadline**: 30 days before commencing operations

**Required Information:**
1. Legal name and address of the provider
2. Legal status and ownership structure
3. Description of intended data intermediation service
4. Estimated start date of the service
5. Member State where the service will be provided
6. Technical and organizational measures for compliance
7. Procedure for handling complaints
8. Estimated number of users in first year of operation

**Competent Authority Review:**
- Acknowledgment within 10 working days
- Concerns raised within 60 working days
- No objection equals approval to operate

### Data Altruism Organizations

**Registration Process:**
1. Submit application to national competent authority
2. Demonstrate non-profit objective and governance
3. Provide evidence of data protection compliance
4. Show technical capability for secure data processing
5. Establish transparent policies for data use

**Registration Requirements:**
- Legal personality under national law
- Statutes must specify data altruistic purposes
- Non-profit structure with transparent governance
- Independent oversight body
- Annual transparency reporting

## Operational Requirements

### Data Intermediation Services

- Cybersecurity measures aligned with NIS2

#### Transparency Measures
- Public information about:
  - Terms and conditions for data sharing
  - Data quality requirements
  - Pricing structure (if applicable)
  - Technical specifications
  - Complaint handling procedures

### Data Altruism Organizations

#### Data Processing Principles
- Purpose limitation to registered altruistic objectives
- Data minimization in collection and processing
- Technical and organizational measures for data protection
- Regular deletion of personal data when no longer needed

#### Transparency and Accountability

## Cross-Border Operations

### Single Point of Contact

- Main establishment determines competent authority
- Cooperation mechanisms with other Member States
- Consistent interpretation of DGA requirements

### Third Country Operations
- Adequacy decisions for data transfers
- Appropriate safeguards required
- Special attention to government access to data
- Regular review of transfer arrangements

## Interaction with Other EU Laws

### GDPR Coordination
- DGA notification does not replace GDPR compliance
- Data protection impact assessments may be required
- Appointment of Data Protection Officer recommended
- Joint controller arrangements may apply

### Digital Services Act Overlap
- Online platforms may need dual compliance
- Content moderation not covered by DGA
- Risk assessment coordination recommended
- Transparency reporting alignment beneficial

### AI Act Implications
- AI systems using shared data must comply with AI Act
- High-risk AI systems need additional safeguards
- Foundation models using altruistic data have transparency obligations
- Algorithmic transparency may be required

### Competition Law Considerations
- Data sharing arrangements must not restrict competition
- Market dominance considerations for large platforms
- Coordination with national competition authorities
- Merger control implications for data intermediaries

## Enforcement and Compliance

### Supervisory Authorities
- National competent authorities designated by Member States
- Powers include investigation, inspection, and sanctions
- Cross-border cooperation mechanisms
- Annual reporting to European Commission

### Penalties and Sanctions
- Administrative fines up to 1% of total worldwide annual turnover
- Periodic penalty payments for continued infringement
- Suspension or restriction of data intermediation services
- Public warnings and reputational measures

### Compliance Monitoring
- Regular audits of technical and organizational measures
- Complaint handling effectiveness review
- User satisfaction surveys
- Cybersecurity incident reporting
