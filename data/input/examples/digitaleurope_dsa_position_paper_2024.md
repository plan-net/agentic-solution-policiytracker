# DigitalEurope Position Paper: Digital Services Act Implementation Concerns

**Organization**: DigitalEurope  
**Date**: April 8, 2024  
**Document Type**: Industry Position Paper  
**Recipients**: European Commission DG CONNECT, European Parliament IMCO Committee  
**Reference**: DE/2024/DSA-IMP/001  

## Executive Summary

DigitalEurope, representing 35,000+ digital technology companies across Europe, submits this position paper regarding implementation concerns with the Digital Services Act (DSA) ahead of the June 1, 2024 enforcement deadline. While we support the DSA's objectives of creating a safer digital environment, we request clarifications and adjustments to ensure proportionate implementation that maintains European digital competitiveness.

## Key Concerns and Recommendations

### 1. Risk Assessment Timing and Methodology

**Current Requirement**: Annual risk assessments due September 1, 2024
**Industry Concern**: Insufficient time for comprehensive assessment methodology development
**Recommendation**: 
- Extend first risk assessment deadline to December 1, 2024
- Provide standardized risk assessment templates by May 15, 2024
- Allow phased implementation for smaller platforms

**Supporting Companies**: 23 DigitalEurope member companies formally requested this extension, including major e-commerce and social media platforms

### 2. Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) Threshold Clarification

**Current Threshold**: 45 million average monthly active EU users
**Industry Concern**: Unclear calculation methodology for multi-service platforms
**Recommendation**:
- Clarify whether threshold applies per service or aggregated across company portfolio
- Provide 6-month notification period before VLOP designation takes effect
- Allow appeals process for threshold calculations

**Economic Impact**: Estimated compliance costs difference of €50-200 million annually per company depending on interpretation

### 3. Content Moderation Resource Requirements

**Current Obligation**: "Adequate resources" for content moderation (Article 16)
**Industry Position**: Vague standard creates compliance uncertainty
**Proposed Metrics**:
- Response time standards: 24 hours for illegal content, 7 days for terms of service violations
- Staffing ratios: 1 moderator per 100,000 monthly active users minimum
- Language coverage: Native language moderation for markets representing >5% user base

### 4. Data Access for Researchers and Authorities

**Industry Concerns**:
- **Privacy Conflicts**: GDPR Article 6 lawful basis unclear for research data access
- **Commercial Sensitivity**: Risk of exposing proprietary algorithms and business data
- **Technical Feasibility**: API development timelines incompatible with June 2024 deadline

**Proposed Solutions**:
- Staged implementation: anonymized data first (Q3 2024), full access Q1 2025
- Clear data minimization principles
- Commercial confidentiality protections for algorithmic data
- Standardized API specifications developed with industry input

## Financial Impact Analysis

### Compliance Cost Estimates (DigitalEurope Member Survey)

**Large Platforms (>45M users)**:
- Initial compliance setup: €25-75 million per platform
- Annual ongoing costs: €15-50 million per platform
- Third-party audit costs: €3-8 million annually

**Medium Platforms (10-45M users)**:
- Initial compliance setup: €5-15 million per platform
- Annual ongoing costs: €2-8 million per platform
- Technology upgrades: €3-10 million one-time investment

### Employment Impact
- **New Hires Required**: 15,000-25,000 compliance and moderation jobs across EU
- **Skills Gap**: Critical shortage of qualified content moderation and AI ethics professionals
- **Training Investment**: €200-500 million industry-wide for staff upskilling

## Industry Cooperation Proposals

### 1. Multi-Stakeholder Implementation Working Group
**Participants**: European Commission, platform companies, civil society, academic researchers
**Mandate**: Develop practical implementation guidelines
**Timeline**: Monthly meetings starting May 2024 through December 2024

### 2. Information Sharing Framework
**Proposal**: Industry-wide database for illegal content patterns and emerging threats
**Benefits**: Improved detection efficiency, reduced duplicate moderation efforts
**Privacy Safeguards**: Hashed content identifiers, no personal data sharing

### 3. Cross-Border Coordination Mechanism
**Challenge**: 27 different national interpretations of DSA requirements
**Solution**: Harmonized enforcement guidelines through European Board for Digital Services
**Timeline**: Finalize by August 2024 to ensure consistent September implementation

## Enforcement and Penalty Concerns

### Proportionality Principle
**Industry Position**: Penalties up to 6% global turnover disproportionate for first-time technical violations
**Requested Adjustments**:
- Grace period for good-faith compliance efforts
- Graduated penalty structure based on violation severity
- Clear distinction between systemic violations and technical non-compliance

### Due Process Rights
**Concerns**: Insufficient appeal mechanisms for platform designation and penalty decisions
**Recommendations**:
- 30-day notice period for penalty proceedings
- Independent review board for platform designations
- Right to technical expert testimony in penalty hearings

## Global Regulatory Coordination

### Harmonization Opportunities
DigitalEurope supports coordination between DSA and similar initiatives:
- **UK Online Safety Bill**: Joint industry consultation on interoperable compliance
- **US Section 230 Reform**: Technical cooperation on content moderation standards
- **California Age-Appropriate Design Code**: Aligned implementation timelines

### Trade Implications
- **WTO Compliance**: Ensure DSA implementation doesn't create discriminatory barriers
- **Trans-Atlantic Cooperation**: Regular dialogue with US tech sector on compliance approaches
- **Market Access**: Prevent fragmentation of global digital services market

## Specific Requests to European Commission

### Immediate Actions Needed (By May 1, 2024)
1. Publish detailed risk assessment methodology guidance
2. Clarify VLOP threshold calculation for multi-service companies
3. Provide template reporting formats for transparency obligations
4. Establish clear appeals process for platform designations

### Medium-Term Priorities (Q3-Q4 2024)
1. Launch multi-stakeholder implementation working group
2. Develop standardized API specifications for researcher data access
3. Create harmonized enforcement guidelines for national authorities
4. Establish cross-border information sharing protocols

## Conclusion

DigitalEurope remains committed to the successful implementation of the Digital Services Act while ensuring European digital competitiveness. We request continued dialogue and practical adjustments to create a regulatory framework that achieves safety objectives without stifling innovation or creating disproportionate compliance burdens.

The next 60 days are critical for clarifying implementation details. DigitalEurope stands ready to provide technical expertise and facilitate industry cooperation to ensure smooth DSA deployment across the European Union.
