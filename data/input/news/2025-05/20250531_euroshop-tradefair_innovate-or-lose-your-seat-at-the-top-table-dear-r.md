# Innovate – or lose your seat at the top table, dear retailers

Over the course of the past three decades, the composition of the top global retailers has seen significant churn, with few managing to maintain a lead position. Established players have been usurped by creative newcomers that have prioritized innovation, staying ahead of the curve in terms of technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. A new study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and World Retail Congress (WRC), launched at World Retail Congress 2024 this week, detailed how retailers can successfully ignite their innovation engines. 
 Retailers leading the way in innovation are investing an average of 13% of annual revenue in innovation initiatives and seeing a 21% ROI for their efforts, according to the report, report Investing in the Future: How Retailers Use Innovation to Gain an Edge. By contrast, retail laggards invest an average of only 3% of revenue in innovation and get a 9% ROI. As a result, laggards often fall into a vicious cycle where lower investment in innovation pilots is insufficient to drive a step change in performance and results in lower ROI, which in turn leads to further reductions in funding for innovation. 
 The report, which surveyed more than 400 senior leaders across 11 retail sectors, also revealed that innovation leaders are prioritizing investments in three areas: operational improvements (71%); e-commerce (60%); and big data, AI, and analytics (58%). What’s more, the report found that leaders aren’t afraid to be bold in their approach to innovation: they invest in multiple innovation projects at once, partner with third parties on innovation initiatives, and seek to shape consumer preferences rather than simply react to trends. 
 Nate Shenck, BCG’s global head of retail, said, “Even in a year of uncertainty with many focused on delivering on the basics, continual innovation remains crucial for retailers to maintain competitive advantage. You have to fight on a weekly, daily, and hourly basis to maintain it.”
