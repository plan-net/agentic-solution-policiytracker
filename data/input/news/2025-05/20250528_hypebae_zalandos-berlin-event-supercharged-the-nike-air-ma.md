Serving up makeup booths, charm making, and an all-female music showcase.

When it comes to the Nike Air Max series, there is undoubtedly a longstanding history of silhouettes associated with men. But, in an effort to change the narrative, Zalando teamed up with the sportswear brand to honor the new Air Max DN8 with a style showcase tailored for women in Berlin. 
 Marking a new chapter for the Air Max, last week’s event invited attendees to turn up in their loudest and boldest expressions of personal style. With some adorning dramatic makeup, and others dressed in DIY outfits, it was evident that every guest understood the assignment – exchanging beauty tips and style tricks with their fashion-loving counterparts as they eagerly awaited the doors to open to the former shopping mall Cank. 
 Inside, the expansive venue in Neukölln was revamped, taking notes from the city’s industrial architecture with steel grating and repurposed tube lighting. On one side, a shoe charm booth was erected from corrugated steel panes cut out with circles to emulate the sneaker’s air bubbles. Opposite, makeup artists and tooth gem technicians were posed against a projected video of the new Zalando campaign while in the center, an LED board that rotated messages like “#herairmax” and “This is her city,” honed in on the message for the night.
 As attendees explored the various activities on offer, a line-up of local artists curated by isla radio took the stage. “The girls performing today represent the underground Berlin sound in a really expressive way,” shared Berlin native DJ VV$ and creative lead of the radio show about her approach to the programming. “Everything in the city centers around techno, but other genres don’t get their moment, especially when it comes to underground sounds and upcoming DJs. I wanted to give them the freedom to play what they want and express their femininity through it.”

After sets by Bounty and Cocoa, Eli Preiss and Hanaby, a brief intermission from the music took place for a style catwalk. Drawing inspiration from ballroom culture, which revolves around the art of voguing, the central escalators were paused, and models wearing the Air Max DN8 made their way down in a high-energy showcase. The event’s headliner Badmómzjay also made a special appearance in a sleek version of her iconic smart-meets-sporty looks to conclude the showcase.
 “What is great about [the silhouette] is that you can wear them with everything,” the German rapper told Hypebae about how she likes to wear Nike Air Max. “Today, I’m wearing them with a shirt and tie, but you could also wear them with a dress. It’s not about what you wear but how you wear it.” Having spectated the earlier performances from the top floor, she also discussed the joy of rapping in an all-female line-up, saying, “Being around my girls is what empowers me the most. I love the energy, and everyone just wants to let loose and party.”
 To close the night, Badmómzjay followed up on a set from best friend and campaign -mate, Mel Olori. The act everyone had been waiting for, she opened with “Survival Mode Intro” and later a recital of her hit track “Hallelujah” and “Auf Die Party,” which got the crowd singing along in unison, amplifying the power of female energy in shared spaces.
