Company will showcase an AI-powered Modern Store experience at NRF together with some top retailers and a robust ecosystem of solutions partners

Zebra Technologies Corporation 
 (NASDAQ: ZBRA), a global leader in digitizing and automating frontline workflows, today announced several new products and AI innovations for the retail industry. Zebra’s solutions will be showcased in booth #3303 as part of Zebra’s AI-powered Modern Store at 
 NRF 2025 Retail’s Big Show 
 on Jan. 12-14, 2025, at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York.

Zebra is unveiling the Zebra 
 Mobile Computing AI Suite, a comprehensive set of tools that includes an AI data capture software development kit (SDK) and example applications optimized for select Zebra Android mobile devices. This suite facilitates the development of AI applications, enabling customers, developers, and independent software vendors (ISV) to easily integrate cutting-edge vision AI capabilities into their mobile applications.

Zebra has leveraged these AI capabilities to enable frontline workers to easily, accurately and quickly capture workflow context and integrate that directly to 
 Zebra Companion, a new and comprehensive suite of AI agents specifically designed to empower retail frontline workers. This multimodal generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) solution is being developed in collaboration with select customers to work with frontline retail workers to improve productivity and elevate the customer experience.

Zebra Companion provides frontline workers instant access to critical information and troubleshooting assistance as they prioritize and execute routine and issue-prompted tasks. Zebra is committed to customers’ data privacy and ethical AI practices to ensure the secure and responsible use of AI technology. Zebra Companion is available starting in the second quarter of 2025 to select customers and requires admission to our early access pilot program. The suite includes:

Knowledge agent 
 that
 
 offers the ability to conversationally interact with job aids and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to facilitate faster onboarding, giving associates the information they need when they need it.

Sales agent 
 that
 
 assists with product-related questions, real-time queries on product availability and pricing as well as cross-sell and upsell recommendations for associates during customer interactions.

Zebra Device agent 
 that
 
 ensures optimal usage and maintenance of Zebra devices by providing troubleshooting and contextual data integrations, reducing device downtime so retail operations are not disrupted.

Merchandising agent 
 that
 
 combines advanced on-device image recognition technology to assess shelf health and augment workflows for frontline teams to address merchandising issues, such as shelf gaps, misplacements and planograming issues, and inaccurate pricing and signage.

Zebra developed the Merchandising agent as a co-innovation project to help a customer explore how associate and customer experiences can be elevated, and visitors to Zebra’s NRF booth will see the capabilities of the Merchandising agent in action. In the future, Zebra partners, ISVs and developers will be able to deploy agents of their own to interface with Zebra Companion to deliver a common multi-modal user interface to frontline workers on Zebra’s industry-leading solution platform.

“For years, we’ve been embedding AI into our products, elevating outcomes for our customers and partners,” said Yogesh Kulkarni, Vice President, AI Strategy, Zebra Technologies. “Our AI-enabled solutions are shaping the future of frontline operations by creating new ways of working. We’re proud to collaborate with our extensive partner community and customers to enhance our AI and GenAI capabilities to automate workflows, streamline processes and boost efficiency, making work easier every day.”

In Zebra’s 
 
 17 th 
 Annual Global Shopper Study
 , 71% of shoppers expressed concern about the lack of help they received from store associates. However, almost 90% of associates believe they can provide a better customer experience when they have mobile technology tools to help simplify real-time communication and prioritize tasks. This is a primary reason why Zebra is demonstrating new technology at NRF that will enable retailers to extend AI capabilities to frontline workflows and decision-making. In addition to the Mobile Computing AI Suite and Zebra Companion, Zebra is introducing several other solutions aimed at transforming retail operations including:

Zebra Workcloud Sync 
 : Frontline teams can leverage numerous robust communication features in a single application to collaborate better and improve productivity in stores. Workcloud Sync allows team members to connect one-on-one or in a group with colleagues and customers in their preferred language via push-to-talk, Wi-Fi voice and video calling, multimedia messaging, to-dos, and forums. Frontline workers can also access AI capabilities in Workcloud Sync via Zebra Companion’s Knowledge agent.

Zebra Dimensioning Mobile Parcel 
 : This software solution enables 'one-shot' dimensioning of most parcels in under five seconds. The camera and time of flight sensor in select Zebra mobile computers work together with AI and Zebra’s proprietary algorithms to virtually reconstruct and measure cubed and irregularly shaped items. This helps retail associates speed up the process of preparing items for shipment.

Zebra EM45 RFID Enterprise Mobile 
 : Mobile computing and precision-RFID read capabilities come together in this smartphone-like device that can be individually assigned. Featuring an AI-ready platform with Zebra DNA, the EM45 offers a modern user experience and privacy without compromising security. As a result, customers can put the power of Zebra in their pockets, removing the need to carry multiple devices to assist colleagues or customers, monitor operational performance, or optimize inventory.

Zebra MC3400 and MC3450 mobile computers 
 : These devices are available in two form factors that can be configured for retail use cases including front-of-store restocking, back-of-store inventory management and faster ecommerce order fulfillment.

Zebra Kiosk System 
 : This highly flexible, modular solution can be configured in different ways to give shoppers more self-service options and help retailers generate new revenue streams. Peripherals can be added to this interactive system to turn it into a loyalty signup, self-checkout, returns, deli ordering, or check-in station for shoppers or a digital signage solution for highly targeted retail media networks.

Join Zebra and two of its leading retail customers as they share their transformation stories at NRF’s Big Idea Sessions:

Zebra’s Mobile Computing AI Suite empowers partners and retailers to integrate AI vision applications into their workflows, driving operational efficiency.

Zebra Companion consists of the Knowledge agent, Sales agent, Zebra Device agent and Merchandising agent, all designed to help the frontline enhance their productivity and efficiency with the latest innovations from GenAI.
