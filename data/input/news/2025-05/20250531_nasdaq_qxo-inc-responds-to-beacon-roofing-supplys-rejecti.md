(NYSE: QXO) today issued the following statement in response to the announcement by Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (Nasdaq: BECN) that its Board of Directors has rejected QXO’s all-cash $124.25 per share offer. 
 On January 27, 2025, QXO commenced a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Beacon for $124.25 per share in cash, for an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $11 billion, representing a 37% premium to Beacon’s 90-day unaffected volume-weighted average price of $91.02 per share as of November 15, 2024. QXO’s offer price is also higher than Beacon’s shares have ever traded. Beacon’s Board offers no basis for its assertion that QXO's premium offer undervalues Beacon's shares, and the trading price of Beacon’s shares indicates that Beacon’s Board is wrong. “Our offer provides certainty, a significant premium in cash and the ability to close quickly with no regulatory delays, financing risks or diligence conditions," said Brad Jacobs, chairman and chief executive officer of QXO. "Beacon’s filing shows no indication of an actionable third-party alternative. We have made a very compelling offer, and Beacon should let its shareholders decide what is in their best interest.” Notably, Beacon confirmed today it would wait to announce newly constructed 2028 financial projections until March 13, more than a month from today and more than three months from its Board’s initial rejection of QXO‘s offer. There is no reason for Beacon to introduce yet another delay by waiting to disclose its newly formulated projections. QXO's tender offer will be outstanding until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, at the end of February 24, 2025, and it is prepared to complete the acquisition shortly after the tender expires, subject to the terms of the offer. The transaction is not subject to any financing conditions or due diligence conditions, and QXO expects that the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the Canadian Competition Act will have expired or been waived by the time the tender offer expires. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC is acting as lead financial advisor to QXO, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP is acting as legal counsel.
