# Copa Holdings January 2025 Traffic Improves Year Over Year

*By Zacks*

Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA reported traffic numbers for January 2025 on the back of upbeat air-travel demand. Driven by high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) improved on a year-over-year basis in January. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity....

Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA reported traffic numbers for January 2025 on the back of upbeat air-travel demand. Driven by high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) improved on a year-over-year basis in January. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In January, available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 22.1% year over year. Revenue passenger miles increased 23.6% year over year. Since traffic outpaced capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) rose to 86.4% from 85.3% in January 2024. 
 Apart from Copa Holdings, we find another airline company — Ryanair Holdings RYAAY, a European carrier, reported solid traffic numbers for January 2025, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The number of passengers transported on Ryanair flights was 12.4 million in January 2025, reflecting a 2% year-over-year increase. The January load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 91% from 89% in the year-ago period. As we know, production delays at Boeing BA have been hurting the fleet-related plans of most airline companies, and it is no different for RYAAY. RYAAY's growth was hampered by 38 delayed deliveries from Boeing. Ryanair expects its fiscal 2025 traffic to reach almost 200 million (+9%) passengers, subject to no further adverse news on Boeing delivery delays. This marks an improvement from the prior view of reaching 198-200 million passengers (+8%). CPA’s Zacks Rank &amp; Price Performance CPA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
