# Full-year report: A strong result despite significantly lower market prices

*By Vattenfall*

Electricity prices continued to fall in 2024. Still, Vattenfall reports a stable underlying operating profit driven by higher achieved prices in the Nordics and an increased wind power generation. Strategic divestments strengthened the full-year results.

Electricity prices continued to fall in 2024. Still, Vattenfall reports a stable underlying operating profit driven by higher achieved prices in the Nordics and an increased wind power generation. Strategic divestments strengthened the full-year results.

Vattenfall’s President and CEO Anna Borg comments on the full-year report for 2024: 
 2024 has been a year of many challenges in the world around us. Not the least in terms of declining electricity prices and geopolitical and economic uncertainties. However, on a full-year basis, we report a stable underlying operating profit driven by higher achieved prices in the Nordics and an increase in wind power generation that counteracted lower electricity prices. 
 Strategic divestments also strengthened the full-year results. At the same time, we are reporting a weak fourth quarter weighed down by updated cost estimates for nuclear power. Vattenfall is committed to enabling a fossil-free future and therefore plans to invest SEK 170 billion over the period 2025 to 2029, focusing on fossil-free electricity generation and electricity grid. Electricity prices continued to fall in 2024 
 Electricity prices in the Nordics were on average 36% lower for the full year of 2024 compared to 2023. This was driven primarily by the strong hydrological balance, increased wind production and lower continental prices. On the continent, electricity prices dropped by an average of 19% due to lower gas prices and higher wind and solar capacity, but the prices were almost double to those in the Nordics.  
 Higher achieved prices in the Nordics and strategic divestments contribute to a strong result development 
 The underlying operating profit for the full year 2024 was relatively unchanged compared to 2023 and amounted to SEK 19.8 billion. Higher achieved prices in the Nordics and increased wind power generation had a positive effect. This was partially offset by increased provisions for nuclear power as a result of updated cost estimates, which negatively impacted the fourth quarter results.  
 Profit for the full year 2024 increased by SEK 23.0 billion to SEK 33.4 billion. The increase was mainly driven by capital gains related to the sale of 49% of the Nordlicht I &amp; II wind power project to BASF and the sale of the Norfolk offshore wind power project in the UK. Positive market value changes for energy derivatives further strengthened the result. To maintain Vattenfall's competitiveness and profitability, we continue our focus on operational excellence.  
 The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 7 billion for 2024.  
 A stable investment climate and collaboration are crucial for enabling a robust energy system 
 2024 was characterised by geopolitical and economic challenges, which have slowed the energy transition. Despite this, the direction towards fossil freedom remains. Electrification through fossil-free energy is key, not only in the energy transition, but also in securing Sweden and Europe’s future competitiveness. We will need to make extensive investments in fossil-free electricity generation, distribution and storage solutions to meet the future energy demand.  
 Vattenfall plans to invest a total of SEK 170 billion between 2025 and 2029. The majority (61%) of the planned investments are growth investments with a focus on new fossil-free electricity generation. Important projects include the offshore wind power project Nordlicht I and II in Germany and the Zeevonk project in the Netherlands, which combines wind and solar power with hydrogen. To ensure that the electricity system is robust and stable, we need to expand the electricity grid. For this, we plan to invest around SEK 41 billion in connecting new customers to the electricity grid.  
 Last year, we worked at a high pace to enable new nuclear power in Sweden. We continue to evaluate our suppliers and are also looking forward to the Swedish government's report regarding state financing and risk sharing for new nuclear power, a prerequisite for investments in new nuclear power projects in Sweden.  
 To enable the energy system of the future, a stable investment climate and collaboration between companies, governments and citizens are required. We at Vattenfall are ready to build on our integrated and diversified business model and will continue to invest in profitable projects that gives us a competitive edge.
