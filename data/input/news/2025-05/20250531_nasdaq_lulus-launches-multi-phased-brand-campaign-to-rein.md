Full Release LOS ANGELES, March 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lulu's Fashion Lounge Holdings, Inc. (“Lulus” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LVLU), the attainable luxury brand for women, is unveiling a bold new multi-phased brand campaign designed to strengthen its position as the go-to dress destination. Spanning three months and kicking off during International Women’s Month, the campaign is dedicated to the women of the brand and will drive brand affinity, customer engagement, and long-term loyalty through a compelling mix of emotional storytelling, product-driven messaging, and cultural relevance. The first part of the campaign will launch on March 7, 2025. “Lulus is a brand built by women, for women, and everything we do, we do for her—our customer,” said Crystal Landsem, Chief Executive Officer at Lulus. “This campaign reflects a strategic investment in long-term customer engagement, reinforcing our presence in the dress market while building a deeper emotional connection with our audience. We are not just selling dresses; we are creating experiences that drive brand loyalty and lifetime value.” As Lulus continues to expand its market presence, this campaign represents a key investment in brand equity, aligning with the Company’s growth strategy by deepening its relationship with both existing and new customers, enhancing brand perception, and driving incremental demand for Lulus’ signature dress assortment. “At Lulus, we are continuously evolving—it’s essential in today’s crowded marketplace to reach new customers and meet their changing needs,” said Patrick Buchanan, Senior Vice President, Brand Marketing, Lulus. “We’re building on the momentum of our last brand campaign, where we saw great success expanding our presence beyond digital channels. This campaign is especially exciting, featuring our Lulus team, the return of customer-facing activations and events, exciting influencer collaborations, and expanded out-of-home marketing. Our past initiatives have proven that a diversified strategy creates a lasting impact, deepens brand affinity, and strengthens our community in powerful ways.” 
 “We Are Lulus” – Celebrating the Women Behind the Brand As a brand built by women, for women, Lulus is spotlighting the talented team behind the scenes with “We Are Lulus.” The campaign kicks off alongside International Women’s Day and Employee Appreciation Day, giving customers a behind-the-scenes look at the employees highlighting the creativity and dedication that bring Lulus to life. Multi-Phased Execution: Scaling Engagement Lulus has built its success on an efficient, data-driven merchandising model that delivers on-trend, high-quality dresses at accessible price points. The campaign expands upon that foundation by reinforcing the brand’s unique positioning in the dress category through a combination of community-driven storytelling and product-first marketing. Each phase of the campaign will align with key consumer touchpoints and purchase behaviors, focusing on moments in a woman’s life where fashion serves as a catalyst for confidence and celebration. Through a mix of paid, earned, and organic media strategies, Lulus will leverage its engaged customer base, robust digital platform, and strong influencer network to amplify reach and impact. By strategically aligning campaign phases with consumer shopping trends and high-engagement periods, Lulus aims to drive sustained demand, strengthen brand recall, and maximize return on marketing investment. Expanding Reach Through Out-of-Home &amp; Market Expansion As part of its multi-channel strategy, Lulus, for the second year in a row, is extending beyond digital with a targeted out-of-home (OOH) advertising initiative. Building on the success of last year’s “Friends for Life” campaign – which nearly doubled brand recall over Lulus’ 2021 digital effort and strengthened brand equity – this year’s “We are Lulus” campaign will feature prime billboard placement in New York’s Time Square, as well as near college campuses in key secondary markets such as Austin, TX, Columbus, OH, Los Angeles, CA, Miami, FL, Nashville, TN, San Diego, CA, Tempe, AZ, and more. By strategically showing up in targeted college cities, Lulus is working to foster early brand loyalty and capture the attention of a high-value demographic at a pivotal stage. Last year’s campaign demonstrated the impact of engaging audiences beyond digital, driving awareness, new customer acquisition, and in-person connections. This year, Lulus is aiming to amplify that success with influencers, in-person events, and offline activations to meet customers where they are – ensuring its message of confidence and attainable luxury reaches women across diverse demographics and locations. 
 Positioning Lulus for Continued Growth &amp; Category Leadership This campaign reflects Lulus’ commitment to building a differentiated brand experience, leveraging its strong digital presence, and scalable marketing strategy to drive profitable growth. Recently, the Company announced expanded reach through strategic collaborations with Nuuly, Poshmark, Von Maur, Dillard’s, and Nordstrom, allowing more customers to experience the brand firsthand. Additionally, curated edits with brands like Dingo 1969, Hunter, Jessica Simpson, Reebok, and Rolla’s Jeans further enhance Lulus’ product offering, bringing fresh styles and new category opportunities to its engaged audience. These collaborations reinforce Lulus’ commitment to expanding brand visibility, diversifying its assortment, and meeting customers where they shop, both online and in-store. As the Company continues to optimize customer acquisition costs and enhance customer lifetime value, these initiatives play a key role in strengthening brand equity and revenue diversification. By integrating authentic storytelling, data-driven product positioning, expanding its strategic collaborations, and a focus on community-building, Lulus is solidifying its place as the leading dress destination—one that resonates deeply with consumers.
