### Amazon CTO's Take on 'Truth' in 2025

- By [David Ramel](https://awsinsider.net/Forms/EmailToAuthor.aspx?AuthorItem={53762E17-6187-46B4-8C04-9DFA282EBB67}&ArticleItem={186C938E-FE7E-430C-8DE3-DF4DFC4EECD6})

The rise of disinformation -- like lies from political figures -- was an existing problem only compounded by the advent of generative AI that can create realistic images, video and audio. As such, it provided a unique topic for 2025 tech predictions from Amazon CTO Werner Vogels.

"Technology tips the scales in the discovery of truth" is one of Vogels' five [tech predictions for 2025 and beyond](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2024/12/tech-predictions-for-2025-and-beyond.html), as he noted in a blog post last month. "As disinformation spreads at unprecedented rates, a new wave of AI-powered tools will emerge to empower journalists, researchers, and engaged citizens in their quest for truth," he said. What's more, this revolution will democratize investigative capabilities while accelerating fact-checking in a beginning effort to close the gap between the spread of misinformation and its debunking.

The demise of journalism -- called "fake news" by some prominent politicians when outlets don't portray them favorably in fact-based content -- figured into his prediction.

"We have rapidly shifted from an era of prolonged news cycles that lasted weeks or months to a constant stream of updates that break at the speed of a click," he said. "Social media platforms have become a primary source for disseminating and consuming news, and it's never been harder to distinguish between what's true and false. A world where being first is more important than being correct has [eroded public trust in traditional media and news outlets](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx). The implications are profound: a significant portion of the populace struggles to identify genuine information (52%), leading to widespread skepticism and sharing of misinformation. Yet, if technology has helped fuel the crisis, it is also the key to solving it."

He pointed to the emergence Open-Source Intelligence ( [OSINT](https://www.dia.mil/About/Open-Source-Intelligence/)) as a vital tool in unraveling complex investigations and uncovering truths hidden beneath layers of deception, while highlighting other hopeful initiatives including:

- The [TrustNet browser extension](https://trustnet.csail.mit.edu/about/extension)
- [GeoSpy](https://geospy.net/) for extracting data from photos and quickly matching features against geographic regions, countries, and cities
- [Proem](https://news.proem.ai/news), providing a necessary aid to validate claims and stem the spread of inaccuracies (both accidental and intentional)
- [$250 million in funding](https://news.crunchbase.com/media-entertainment/disinformation-fighting-startups-vc-investment/) dedicated this year to startups developing solutions to these pressing problems

"In the years ahead, we can expect a shift in the direction of fact," Vogels said. "The development and democratization of these tools will level the playing field, allowing accurate information to flow as rapidly as disinformation. This transition will not only help to restore public trust in traditional news sources, but also enhance the overall quality of discourse across digital platforms. The impact will be far-reaching, benefiting consumers, businesses safeguarding their reputations, and governments and organizations striving to maintain informed populaces.

"As technologists, we have a crucial responsibility in this transformation. By innovating and building tools to help detect and deter disinformation, we can reshape the information landscape. Our collective efforts will contribute to a more informed society, resilient against the tides of digital deception. The path forward is clear: use technology not just to connect the world, but to protect the integrity of the information that binds us."

His other four predictions include:

- **The workforce of tomorrow is mission-driven:** The workforce of tomorrow will not only be driven by financial success and career progression, but by a deeper desire to create positive change in the world. The organizations and businesses that acknowledge this shift and embrace purpose-driven work will be poised for long-term success.
- **A new era of energy efficiency drives innovation:**
- Surging power demand and climate imperatives are driving a transformation in how we generate, store, and consume energy. The expansion of nuclear and continued growth of renewable energy will lay the groundwork for a future where our energy infrastructure is a catalyst for innovation, not a constraint.
- **Open data drives decentralized disaster preparedness:** Disaster resilience will be fundamentally transformed through the power of hyperlocal, community-sourced data. This shift will redefine disaster management from a top-down, reactive model to one that is proactive, decentralized, and community-driven.
- **Intention-driven consumer technology takes hold:** A subtle shift is underway that is redefining our relationship with consumer technology. As more and more people look for a refuge from constant distraction, devices are emerging that prioritize mindfulness, intentionality, and deep thinking over a barrage of fleeting stimuli. In 2025 and beyond, technology will empower rather than distract us -- and we'll be better for it.
