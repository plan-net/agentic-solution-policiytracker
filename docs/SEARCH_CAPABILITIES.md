# Advanced Search Capabilities & Knowledge Graph Tools

*A comprehensive technical guide to the Political Monitoring Agent's sophisticated search and analysis tools*

## üîç Overview

The Political Monitoring Agent v0.2.0 introduces revolutionary search capabilities powered by **Graphiti temporal knowledge graphs**. Unlike traditional search systems that rely on keyword matching or simple LLM-based retrieval, our system provides **graph-native intelligence** that reveals hidden patterns, multi-hop connections, and temporal relationships in political and regulatory data.

## üß† Graph-Powered Intelligence vs Traditional Search

### Traditional Search Limitations

**Keyword-Based Search**:
- ‚ùå Surface-level text matching
- ‚ùå No understanding of entity relationships
- ‚ùå Limited temporal awareness
- ‚ùå Cannot discover indirect connections

**Simple LLM + Retrieval**:
- ‚ùå Treats documents as isolated text chunks
- ‚ùå No persistent knowledge of entity relationships
- ‚ùå Limited ability to reason across multiple sources
- ‚ùå No temporal continuity or evolution tracking
- ‚ùå Cannot perform network analysis or community detection

### Our Graph-Native Approach
