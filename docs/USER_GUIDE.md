## What This System Does

### The Business Problem

Organizations need to monitor thousands of political and regulatory documents to identify which ones actually affect their business. Manual review is:
- **Time-consuming**: Takes days or weeks to process large document batches
- **Inconsistent**: Different reviewers may score the same document differently
- **Expensive**: Requires significant human resources
- **Error-prone**: Important documents can be missed or misclassified

### The Solution

The Political Monitoring Agent automatically analyzes political and regulatory documents to:

1. **Score relevance** to your business (0-100 scale)
2. **Extract key information** that affects your operations
3. **Prioritize documents** by importance and urgency
4. **Group related topics** for easier review
5. **Generate executive summaries** with actionable insights

### Real-World Impact

**Before**: A regulatory affairs team spends days manually reviewing hundreds of documents, struggling to identify the most relevant ones consistently.

**After**: The system processes document batches automatically, scores them for relevance, and highlights the highest-priority items for expert review.

## How It Works: The Complete Process

### Step 1: Document Collection
You provide documents in various formats:
- **PDF files** (regulatory reports, policy papers)
- **Word documents** (.docx format)
- **Text files** (.txt format)
- **Markdown files** (.md format)
- **Web content** (HTML format)

### Step 2: Content Processing
The system extracts and processes the text:
- **Text extraction**: Pulls readable content from all document formats
- **Language detection**: Identifies document language for proper processing
- **Content cleaning**: Removes formatting, headers, footers, and noise
- **Section identification**: Recognizes different parts of documents (titles, paragraphs, lists)

### Step 3: Context Application
Your organization's context is applied:
- **Company identification**: Looks for mentions of your company, brands, subsidiaries
- **Industry matching**: Identifies content related to your business sectors
- **Geographic filtering**: Focuses on your operational markets and jurisdictions
- **Strategic alignment**: Matches content to your business priorities and themes

### Step 4: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Each document is analyzed across five key dimensions:

#### 🎯 Direct Impact Analysis (40% of total score)
- **What it does**: Identifies if the document directly affects your company or business operations
- **How it works**: Searches for company names, regulatory requirements, compliance obligations
- **Example**: "All e-commerce platforms must comply with new data protection rules by June 2024"
- **Score meaning**: 90-100 = Direct regulatory requirements, 70-89 = Industry-wide impacts, 50-69 = Indirect implications

#### 🏭 Industry Relevance Analysis (25% of total score)
- **What it does**: Determines how closely the content relates to your business sectors
- **How it works**: Matches document content against your industry keywords and adjacent sectors
- **Example**: A fintech company would score high on "digital payments regulation" and medium on "general financial services"
- **Score meaning**: 90-100 = Core business impact, 70-89 = Adjacent industry relevance, 50-69 = Indirect sector connection

#### 🌍 Geographic Relevance Analysis (15% of total score)
- **What it does**: Assesses if the document affects markets where you operate
- **How it works**: Identifies jurisdictions, countries, regions mentioned and matches to your market presence
- **Example**: EU regulation scores higher for companies with European operations than those only in Asia
- **Score meaning**: 90-100 = Primary markets, 70-89 = Secondary markets, 50-69 = Global/general scope

#### ⏰ Temporal Urgency Analysis (10% of total score)
- **What it does**: Identifies time-sensitive requirements and deadlines
- **How it works**: Extracts dates, deadlines, implementation timelines, urgency indicators
- **Example**: "Companies must submit compliance reports by March 31" vs "Guidelines will be published next year"
- **Score meaning**: 90-100 = Immediate action required, 70-89 = Near-term deadlines, 50-69 = Future planning

#### 🎯 Strategic Alignment Analysis (10% of total score)
- **What it does**: Matches document content to your strategic priorities and business themes
- **How it works**: Compares content against your defined strategic themes (e.g., digital transformation, sustainability)
- **Example**: A sustainability-focused company scores high on ESG regulations and climate policies
- **Score meaning**: 90-100 = Core strategic themes, 70-89 = Related priorities, 50-69 = Tangential alignment

### Step 5: AI Enhancement & Validation

**Artificial Intelligence Layer** (when enabled):
- **Semantic understanding**: AI models can read and comprehend document meaning beyond keyword matching
- **Context interpretation**: Large language models understand complex regulatory language and implications
- **Quality validation**: AI can verify that rule-based scoring makes sense in context
- **Evidence extraction**: AI identifies the most relevant quotes and passages to support scoring decisions

**Current Implementation**:
- **Primary method**: Rule-based keyword matching and pattern recognition
- **AI enhancement**: Available but disabled by default for cost and complexity reasons
- **Hybrid capability**: System designed to combine both approaches when AI is enabled
- **Fallback behavior**: Fully functional using rule-based methods alone

### Step 6: Results Generation
The system produces comprehensive outputs:
- **Individual document scores** with detailed breakdowns
- **Priority rankings** for all analyzed documents
- **Topic clustering** to group related documents
- **Executive summary** with key findings and recommendations
- **Evidence extracts** showing why each document received its score
