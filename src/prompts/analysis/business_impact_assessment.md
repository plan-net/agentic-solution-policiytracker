# Business Impact Assessment for Political and Regulatory Changes

This prompt guides the comprehensive assessment of how political and regulatory changes affect specific companies and industries.

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

### Impact Dimensions
1. **Financial Impact**: Direct costs, compliance expenses, revenue effects
2. **Operational Impact**: Process changes, system modifications, reporting requirements
3. **Strategic Impact**: Market position, competitive advantage, business model effects
4. **Compliance Impact**: Legal obligations, risk exposure, enforcement likelihood
5. **Reputational Impact**: Public perception, stakeholder relations, brand effects

### Assessment Scope
- **Direct Effects**: Immediate regulatory requirements and obligations
- **Indirect Effects**: Market changes, competitive dynamics, supply chain impacts
- **Temporal Effects**: Short-term disruption vs. long-term strategic implications
- **Jurisdictional Effects**: Multi-jurisdiction coordination and conflicts

## IMPACT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

### 1. REGULATORY MAPPING
**Map Policy → Company Connections**

#### Direct Regulatory Exposure
```
Policy/Regulation → Business Activity → Company Operations → Financial Impact
```

**Analysis Questions:**
- Which specific business activities are regulated?
- What are the compliance requirements and deadlines?
- What are the penalties for non-compliance?
- How do requirements vary by jurisdiction?

#### Indirect Market Effects
```
Policy/Regulation → Industry/Market → Competitive Dynamics → Company Position
```

**Analysis Questions:**
- How does regulation change market structure?
- Do competitors face different compliance burdens?
- Are there first-mover advantages or regulatory arbitrage opportunities?
- What are the barriers to entry/exit effects?

### 2. COMPLIANCE GAP ANALYSIS
**Current State vs. Required State**

#### Gap Identification
- **Process Gaps**: Current processes vs. required procedures
- **System Gaps**: Technology capabilities vs. compliance requirements
- **Documentation Gaps**: Current records vs. required documentation
- **Governance Gaps**: Current oversight vs. required governance structures

#### Implementation Requirements
- **Resource Needs**: Personnel, technology, external consultants
- **Timeline Constraints**: Deadlines, phase-in periods, grandfathering
- **Cost Estimates**: Direct costs, opportunity costs, ongoing compliance costs
- **Risk Mitigation**: Interim measures, fallback options, insurance needs

### 3. STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
**Long-term Business Effects**

#### Business Model Impact
- Does regulation require fundamental changes to how the company operates?
- Are there new revenue opportunities or threats?
- How does regulation affect scalability and growth plans?
- What are the implications for international expansion?

#### Competitive Positioning
- Do regulations favor or disadvantage the company vs. competitors?
- Are there opportunities to gain market share through superior compliance?
- How do compliance costs affect pricing and profit margins?
- What are the implications for innovation and R&D investment?
