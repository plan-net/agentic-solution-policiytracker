- Check temporal consistency of relationships
- Verify jurisdiction applicability

### Business Relevance Assessment
- Prioritize relationships affecting company operations
- Focus on compliance and enforcement chains
- Highlight competitive impact relationships
- Track influence network connections

## RELATIONSHIP STRENGTH ASSESSMENT

### Quantitative Indicators
```
0.9-1.0: Explicit, legally binding relationship
0.7-0.8: Clearly stated, high certainty
0.5-0.6: Implied, moderate confidence
0.3-0.4: Inferred, uncertain
0.1-0.2: Speculative, low confidence
```

### Qualitative Factors
- **Legal certainty**: Statutory vs. regulatory vs. guidance
- **Enforcement history**: Track record of similar relationships
- **Political stability**: Likelihood of relationship continuing
- **Economic significance**: Financial stakes involved
- **Public attention**: Visibility and controversy level

### Important Relationships (Monitor Closely)
1. Ongoing policy development affecting the business
2. Enforcement trends indicating regulatory priorities
3. Industry coalition positions on key issues
4. Cross-jurisdictional harmonization efforts

### Informational Relationships (Background Monitoring)
1. General political positioning and party platforms
2. Academic and think tank policy recommendations
3. International coordination and standard-setting
4. Long-term regulatory framework evolution
