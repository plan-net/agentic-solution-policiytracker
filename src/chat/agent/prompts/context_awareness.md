# Context Awareness Template

Use this template to maintain awareness of conversation context and build upon previous interactions.

## Session Context
**Session ID**: {session_id}
**Duration**: {session_duration}
**Previous Queries**: {recent_queries}

## Conversation Flow

### Building on Previous Context
- Reference entities from earlier questions
- Connect current query to established themes
- Avoid repeating information already provided
- Deepen analysis based on user's demonstrated interests

### Entity Memory
**Frequently Discussed**: {frequent_entities}
**Recently Cached**: {recent_entities}

Use cached entity information to:
- Skip basic details already covered
- Focus on new aspects or deeper analysis
- Make connections to previously discussed entities

### User Patterns
Based on recent queries, the user seems interested in:
- **Primary Focus Areas**: [Infer from query history]
- **Preferred Analysis Depth**: [Surface level / Detailed / Expert level]
- **Question Types**: [Entity exploration / Relationship analysis / Impact assessment]

## Context Integration Guidelines

### When to Reference Previous Context
- User asks follow-up questions ("What about..." "How does this relate to...")
- Current query involves entities from recent conversations
- User asks for deeper analysis of previously mentioned topics

### When to Start Fresh
- User switches to completely different topic
- User asks basic questions about new entities
- Context is from previous session (unless explicitly referenced)

### Memory-Informed Responses
- "Building on our earlier discussion of [entity]..."
- "As we explored with [previous entity], this also shows..."
- "This connects to the [relationship type] we identified earlier..."
- "Compared to [previously discussed entity]..."

## Response Enhancement

### Continuity Signals
Use phrases that acknowledge conversation flow:
- "Following up on [previous topic]..."
- "This builds on what we found about..."
- "Similar to our analysis of [entity]..."
- "This adds another dimension to..."

### Progressive Depth
- **First mention**: Basic details and context
- **Follow-up**: Deeper relationships and implications
- **Advanced**: Network effects and complex patterns

### Cross-Reference Opportunities
Look for connections between:
- Current entities and previously discussed entities
- Current findings and established patterns
- New insights and previous conclusions

## Context Template for Responses

When appropriate, include context awareness in your response:

---

### ðŸ”„ Building on Our Conversation
[Brief reference to relevant previous context]

### ðŸ†• New Insights
[Fresh analysis that extends previous discussion]

### ðŸ”— Connections
[How current findings relate to previous discoveries]

---

## Memory Update Recommendations

After each response, consider updating memory with:
- Key entities discussed
- Important relationships discovered
- User preferences or interests demonstrated
- Follow-up questions that might be relevant
